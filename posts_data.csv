H2020 2019 call topic n1 - Strengthening Internet Trustworthiness,18 Feb 2019,"Modern news publishers have a big problem.  
Industry standard is to publish reports -- even when incomplete -- within minutes of critical events.
However, today's fact-checking processes take up to *13 hours* to correct information in those rushed reports.
And if any mistakes slip through the cracks, as the saying goes, that misinformation travels halfway around the world before the truth can even put on its pants.
In our polarized world, misinformation has shown significant power to shape public opinion and influence the direction of our societies.  If we want to share a *trustworthy* digital landscape, which empowers us to better understand our world and make better decisions because of it, we must create new tools to validate our online information -- and fact-checking is a pillar of that effort.
My name is Sam Butler, and I'm working on a project called CrowdFact.  Our objectives are to (a) reduce the current response time on misinformation from 13 hours to a matter of minutes, and (b) provide a model for stabilizing and protecting the digital information landscape in advance of the worldwide 2020 election cycles.
Our tool solves the aforementioned problems by bringing fact-checking power *outside* the newsroom.  With our browser overlay technology, anyone can publicly fact-check claims -- on *any* piece of online content -- and ""bridge"" them to supporting/refuting evidence, which will be visible to all other users looking at that content.
Here's a video of our tool in action:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FphXsJS7wtA#t=02m05s
Presuming users have fact-checking competence and good intentions, this solution is robust.
-- But when they *don't?*
As a digital community, that is a question we must address.
In our tool, when users cite (or ""bridge"") evidence to *contradict* an existing claim, that claim is highlighted in *red* to alert other readers of potential misinformation.  When users bridge evidence to *support* an existing claim, that claim is highlighted in *green*, to signal validity to other readers.  When users have bridged both *contradicting and supporting* evidence for a given claim, that claim is highlighted in *yellow* to alert other readers that it is questionable and up-for-debate.  
See this image for a visual representation:  
https://imgur.com/a/hCVaBIw 
The biggest problem here is that we don't have an objective way to *evaluate* the quality of bridged evidence -- including the sensibility of the citation and the trustworthiness of the referenced source.    
In short, someone can make a random ""contradicting"" bridge on a completely valid claim, and make that claim be highlighted in red to appear untrustworthy.  Someone can likewise make a random ""supporting"" bridge on a completely false claim, and make that claim be highlighted in green to appear trustworthy.  
If other users fail to explore these bridges and simply take the color of the highlighted text at face-value, they can come away with the impression that misinformation is true and real information is false, which is a dangerous outcome.  
So the question becomes: how *can* we objectively evaluate the quality of bridges?
Several solutions to come to mind, but each of them have their own flaws.  
1. Internal platform moderation
Whenever a user bridges a claim to supporting/contradicting evidence, that bridge is evaluated by internal staff to determine its validity.  Only after passing this moderation will a bridge be publicly displayed.  
However, what if a user make a legitimate bridge to contradict a disreputable claim in an article -- and while that bridge awaited moderation, other users read the article's misinformation and accepted it as true?  
This demonstrates the tradeoff of speed and reliability in any fact-checking effort.
Flaws: Slows down the tool's fact-checking capabilities, doesn't scale with user activity, potential for platform + moderator biases
2. Crowdsourced moderation 
When users bridge claims to supporting/contradicting evidence, that bridge is immediately visible to (at least some portion of) the existing user base.  Any time a user comes across a supporting/contradicting bridge, they will soon have an incentive (based on a cryptocurrency rewards protocol) to explore that bridge, and flag it if it appears unsubstantiated.
With a trusted crowd of user-moderators -- who could potentially view supporting/contradicting bridges prior to the rest of the community -- this could be an effective and scalable solution.  
Likewise, if the broader userbase positively responds to the incentive and takes it upon themselves to evaluate any encountered bridges, this could also be an effective and scalable solution.
Flaws: Allows unmoderated bridges to become publicly visible, risking that others may erroneously internalize them.  If relying on user-moderators, you are susceptible to their biases while slowing down the tool's fact-checking capabilities.
3. Tangible disincentives
As described in the preceding paragraph, our technology will include a platform-specific cryptocurrency which can reward users for their fact-checking efforts.  
Similarly, we can also create opportunity costs for publishing misinformation and disreputable bridges.  
Through their activity on our platform, users will have an opportunity to earn a share of daily token rewards.  If users have been found to post misinformation/disreputable bridges, they could lose a portion of their projected rewards tokens to disincentivize that foul play.
The biggest strengths of this solution are that it (a) preemptively disincentives bad actors, and (b) incentives bad actors to personally correct their own disreputable activity.
Flaws: If users are willing to accept this disincentive in exchange for publishing misinformation, this solution is ineffective
4. Machine-learning verification
Use algorithms to (a) analyze all available information about a given bridge and the evidence that it cites to support/refute a claim, (b) calculate the projected validity of the bridge, and (c) determine whether or not to make this bridge publicly available.  
ML verification can be a near-instantaneous and reliable source of moderation.  Furthermore, the exact process of its moderation can be tweaked to include effective human collaboration and improved reliability.  
For example, if the algorithm calculates a low trust score for a given bridge, that bridge can be instantly flagged and sent to a human moderator to determine proper action.  
Flaws: The algorithm itself is a source of bias.  Is CNN a reputable source?  Is Fox News?  Breitbart?  Is the data from which the algorithm learns which sources are reputable and disreputable are a reliable source itself?  Are the biases of the humans creating this algorithm diminishing its objectivity?  What *is* the objective truth that this algorithm is based on?
Conclusion:  
We have the technology to build new fact-checking protocols for the Internet and meet the instantaneous supply of new online information.
However, as those solutions involves more crowdsourced participation and machine learning (and a higher volume of fact-checking activity in general), a new challenge comes to mind.  
*How can we fact-check the fact checks?*
This is a complex problem facing all technologies in the anti-misinformation space, with the consequences affecting all of us who rely on digital information.
We've shared some of our ideas for solutions -- and now, we'd love to hear yours.  
Share feedback on our proposals, and propose any ideas you have to improve the speed and reliability of next-gen fact-checking tools.

H2020 2019 call topic n1 - Strengthening Internet Trustworthiness,19 Nov 2018,"Hi All,
My team at Weizmann is engaged on basic research on the foundations of e-democracy.
For a foundational discussion see: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/8/229759-point/pdf For some of our work, see: https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Shapiro%2C+Ehud&searchtype=author&order=...
Here is a relevant abstract of a work-in-progress: A Global Web of Trust of Global Identities: Supporting an Open and Sybil-Resilient e-Democracy
 
A key threat to any open electronic community in general, and to an open e-democracy in particular, is fake identities, aka sybils: They undermine the integrity of the community, hamper equality, subvert accountability and are a potent source of manipulation and disinformation, thus promoting distrust. Critically, a swarm of sybils may attack an e-democracy in concert and overtake it. Genuine global identities are needed in a broad range of contexts, to increase credibility and accountability on the net ֿ( https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PublicIdentity.html ) in general, and to enable democratic processes +( https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/8/229759-point/pdf ) in particular.
To help achieve that, we propose here a notion of a self-sovereign and decentralized global identity that consists of a public key and a profile, which may be cryptographically-hashed for privacy. People can create their own global identities and form a global web of trust among them. We explore the properties of global identities, their profiles and their global web of trust and outline their potential realization in compliance with the emerging standards of Decentralized Identity ( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/ ) (DID) and Verifiable Credentials ( https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model ) (VC) and with privacy-related regulation, in particular the EU GDPR.

H2020 2019 call topic n1 - Strengthening Internet Trustworthiness,01 Aug 2018,"On March 21st 2018, the Engineroom project ran an expert workshop in London to support the establishment of a research agenda for the Next Generation Internet. One of the activities was to examine challenges for a set of umbrella topics. ""Online Identities and Trust"" was one of those topics and four distinct areas of discussion were elicited:
General thoughts;
Challenges;
Opportunities;
Examples.
Online Identities and Trust
Described as: There is a need for secure online identity verification and management system that can replace the trustless system with trust-enhancing solutions which would be alternatives to codifying trust through reputation systems. 
General thoughts
Instead of various identities for each individual issued by various governments, federated identities will enhance trust, security and reputation.
New identity formations are in place which contain characteristics from governments, business world and individuals e.g. World Identity Network, ID2020, YouPort etc.
E-Estonia is a great example and an important source of inspiration that makes Estonia as the world’s most sophisticated digital government/economy.
Challenges
Instead of choosing good and favourable processes, we used to select what is more convenient. Complexity of convenience is a big challenge against change.
Decentralised identity systems need some sort of verifiability or legitimacy from a wider community.
Europe needs to look for an alternative, realistic, and optimistic vision which should revolve around immutable, and trustworthy identity systems.
Opportunities
Europe needs to benefit from the world’s most sophisticated identity and e-government system (e-Estonia) of Estonia and scale it on a European level.
Europe-wide identity management system makes a more frictionless single market and would solve a lot of economic issues.
Examples
Alice is a platform that brings transparency to social funding through blockchain technology.
Yoti is a London-based technology company on a mission to become the world’s trusted identity platform.

H2020 2019 call topic n1 - Strengthening Internet Trustworthiness,09 May 2018,"According to The NGI Study draft final report, the universal ""neutrality principal"" that lies at the heart of the Internet allows everyone to use the Internet to its full potential without holding back. It is essential for democratic ownership of the digital society. It can be achieved only with the use of trustworthy technologies that can be relied upon by all users of the Internet. This can be done by the identification and deprecating existing non-trustworthy elements and creating new trustworthy components. This requires applying severe scrutiny to key 'commodity' protocols and widespread implementations. The core networking components need to be clean without defects or backdoors. The built-in security of core networking components may be the only line of defence for many applications and services on top of the network.
For now, especially in case of critical or vulnerable applications, the security and integrity of the network should not be treated as axiomatic and additional measures need to be taken with the costs and additional efforts associated. This way the NGI will help to create security transparency, meaning that users will be able to adequately grasp their overall security situation. The amount of suspect technologies we cannot avoid to rely on ultimately needs to be reduced to zero. This is a very significant but unavoidable task if future contamination is to be prevented. It requires a structured long-term approach where step by step core technologies are either proven to be secure (possibly after improvements) and can remain in use, or are replaced with better solutions. The urgency of this effort cannot be overestimated, given the high economic and social stakes. The end result should be a growing set of essential internet technologies which can be fully trusted as building blocks for any purpose.
The list of reliable (best practise) technologies should be actively maintained during the NGI. This is considered a pivotal aspect of the NGI initiative. This will help NGI to significantly improve security transparency, which means that users will have better understanding of their overall security situation on the Internet.

H2020 2019 call topic n2 - Service and Data Portability,08 May 2018,"The NGI Study draft final report recognizes the need for service portability and data decoupling as essential to achieving the vision of next generation Internet.
Service portability and data decoupling outlines the need for empowering users to separate their content and data from internet software and services. This ability will transform market-dominant ‘black box’ internet services into universally available alternatives available to all as generic ‘white label’ building blocks that can be reused and adopted by anyone. This re-establishes the boundaries between content owner and service provider, allowing alternative and complementary services to be mixed and matched. It will also safeguard openness and diversity by actively steering away from market monopolies. In addition, without the pressure to maximise profit, services can be cleaned from psychological manipulation, be made more efficient and better adhere to the ethical preferences of the user. Following is the motivation and benefits of this approach.
User Mobility: Monolithic internet services result in a soft lock-in of the user community with one or a few companies. The overall cost of switching providers becomes too high, which means users can no longer autonomously decide to leave because they are co-dependent on a group of peers they use the service with. At that point users are at the mercy of the supplier, even if that user is facing very unfavourable or even unethical treatment or the service is no longer satisfactory. In the common case where multiple services are combined from a single very large company, these effects are even stronger.
Users should be able to choose service providers and/or host services themselves. Users should be able to use services that have the best match with their needs, ethics and rights at any point. At the very least they should be able to switch providers without friction, and to choose the conditions under which their services are run and where their data is stored. This also makes sense as user needs are not static and universal. Allowing the user data to be decoupled and independent of service providers will boost the availability of commons alternatives for important internet services such as calendar, instant messaging, etc. and hence favouring user mobility.
Increased competition and resiliency: Service portability and data decoupling go hand in hand to help achieve openness to new entrants by unlocking clustered service verticals that have strong market positions. This will provide active countermeasures against market dominance and launch a competitive ecosystem of strong solution providers with a level playing field. By favouring the introduction of suitable microscale alternatives as a result of data independency, the monolithic dependency on individual hyperscale service providers can be dissolved, resilience be increased as there will be no single point of failure, and European or localized service providers become more competitive.
Standardization and reduced friction: The goal herein is to establish suitable mature technology commons for popular end user services as open source, which are not bound to be hosted on any one individual company and have no friction cost for switching. These ‘commons services’ should contribute to standardization to reduce friction so that data and content is easily portable across instances in different providers. By introducing suitable microscale alternatives and interoperable standards that can be universally deployed, individual service providers are no longer a single point of failure and resilience will be significantly increased.
Diverse, Inclusive and Localized Services: Service provider’s businesses considerations are not supportive of incorporating broad social and cultural diversity into the nature of services, and the needs of economically marginal user groups are left under-represented. Availability of open-source building blocks will reduce the cost of innovation and foster creation of suitable microscale alternatives that are representative of the needs of economically marginalized and people with disabilities, and also provision services in many local languages, boosting diversity.
The report also recognizes that without prioritizing data decoupling and service portability, we face following risks.
Stagnation of overall innovation
Vendor dominance due to Metcalfe’s law creates single points of (significant) failure in each domain
Lack of alternatives makes users vulnerable to targeted profiling and exploitation.
European businesses are at an unfair competitive disadvantage.
Failure to reach the overall vision of the NGI.
In addition, the report proposes inviting projects proposals that create the generic infrastructure to facilitate data decoupling and frictionless switching such as –
remote storage and transfer of content separate from software provisioning
Solutions to reuse non-commercial social and business graphs.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,27 Sep 2018,"Renovating the Internet architecture is no easy feat: it not only depends on the technology, but also on complex social, political and economic interactions and interests from the multiple Internet ecosystem stakeholders. However, getting the technology right is crucial towards lying a strong foundation for a secure, decentralized and more performing Next Generation Internet (NGI).
My team at i2CAT has been collaborating with a global community of academic and industry researchers that have worked in research/development of RINA, the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture, for the last 6 years (see http://pouzinsociety.org). RINA is an Internetwork architecture whose fundamental principle is that networking is only inter-process communication (IPC). RINA reconstructs the overall structure of the Internet, forming a model that comprises a single repeating layer, the DIF (Distributed IPC Facility), which is the minimal set of components required to allow distributed IPC between application processes. RINA supports inherently and without the need of extra mechanisms mobility, multi-homing and Quality of Service, provides a secure and configurable environment, motivates for a more competitive marketplace and allows for a seamless adoption.
During the last years we have been investigating (theoretically and experimentally) the properties of RINA, building open-source implementations, deploying experiments on large-scale testbeds, analysing how to interoperate with existing technologies. The results have been published in a number of journal and conference papers (http://pouzinsociety.org/research/publications). We think it is the right time for more groups to jump in, specially open source communities, to facilitate large-scale validation and assesment of RINA as the simplest yet more powerful possible Internet architecture.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,02 Aug 2018,"A topic related to this, ""Cyber Security and Resilience"" was under discussion at the Engineroom project's expert workshop in London, March 2018. Four distinct areas of discussion were elicited:
General thoughts;
Challenges;
Opportunities;
Examples.
Cyber Security and Resilience
Described as: There is a need for secure internet infrastructure and protocols which are resilient against cyber-physical attacks with future-proof encryption. 
General thoughts
The incentives of actors in cyber security need to be realigned.
There is a trade-off between resilience and efficiency. Everything is currently optimised for efficiency which is not suitable for cyber security in the long run.
Challenges
Cheap technologies are not necessarily secure because they cost less. For example webcams and other such kind of devices can be turned into nodes in botnets as happened with the Mirai botnet.
Cybersecurity is seen as very complex, so people tend to disengage. People need to take this issue very seriously.
Lack of accountability and regulation, and insufficient public awareness leads to higher risk of cyber threats.
New business models are needed which include incentives to put cyber security and resilience at the core of the products.
Need new regulation, for example the EU’s upcoming NIS directive, equivalent to the GDPR but for cyber security and CNI.
Opportunities
European tech should be known to the secure-by-design. Europe has a real opportunity and potential in developing secure technology.
This will also be an opportunity to bring back hardware production to Europe and to set global standards.
There is a good opportunity for European start-ups to fill the gap in the market looking at tamper-proof ledgers, and other emerging solutions.
Examples
Equifax (example of what not to do!) was a massive data breach caused by shoddy security standards.
Bitcoin mining in websites (new type of crime!) without consent by the user, who inadvertently give up their computing power (through JavaScript scripts).

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,09 May 2018,"Growing dependency on a few operators might increase the risk of single point of failure. In order to avoid this risk and to make Internet services more resilient, network can be segmented in such a way that issues in one segment have no side effects in other segments/parts of the network, which would allow for uninterrupted use outside of any affected areas. Furthermore, the service quality degradation can be avoided by providing multiple independent alternatives access networks (multihoming), and other means of smarter asset distribution as presented in this discussion. 
Many resources on the web and the wider internet are no longer self-contained, but have hard-coded dependencies on resources delivered by third parties, such as content delivery networks and cloud providers. These are used for critical features such as navigation. An outage somewhere in this chain can ripple an avalanche of unintended outages throughout many different systems. An example is the whois of a registry that needs to be able to be used in case of emergencies to notify the administrators of a certain domain, but turns out to depend on 3rd party Javascript sources.
Resilient Internet services can be achieved by ensuring high availability, openness and disruption tolerance as also detailed here. This will ultimately improve operational efficiency of the Internet, lower the operational cost, increase privacy by removing central vantage points, improve disaster-readiness and ensure business continuity and social connectivity.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,08 May 2018,"Creating a future proof Internet infrastructure requires continuous optimisation and integration of best practises at all levels, including at the hardware and system integration level. While the software market has been commodified and democratised through free software (aka open source), the hardware market is still dominated by a small amount of vendors. Commodification of the development of networking hardware, from full-blown optical networking equipment to embedded systems and hardware cryptographic components, can help to ensure higher availability, lower costs, increase transparency and diversity, and create a more open market where anyone may introduce highly complex new services that require strongly optimised and well-integrated hardware and software.
NGI report recognizes extensible and reliable open hardware as an essential contributor towards achieving NGI vision, with the following identified benefits and risks respectively.
Benefits
Lower costs for market entrants
Increased reusability of efforts. Otherwise there is a risk of vendor specific feature delivery with low reusability.
Reduced market dominance of (mostly non-European) hardware vendors
Increased transparency, otherwise in-transparency of hardware can lead to security breaches.
Improved energy use and resource efficiency mitigating suboptimal development of ecological optimisations.
Risks of not addressing this topic

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,07 May 2018,"The NGI Study draft final report discusses the topic of architecture renovation. At the heart of the NGI is architectural evolution that improves upon legacy core protocols of the internet by investigating alternative or auxiliary core infrastructures. This would include projects that are aimed at changing the underlying fabric of the internet and the web itself. Many fundamental issues with resilience and robustness can only be fixed at a systemic level, but the inertia to integrate new solutions into existing Internet is too huge. The matters have been aggravated by the fact that many practical workarounds have been found meanwhile to cater for explosive demand. These workarounds have raised cost, complexity, and even further worsened the known fragility and inflexibility of Internet. The complexity of designing a successful architecture upgrade is easily illustrated by the fact that over half of the life time of the internet has already been spent on the (arguably not very successful) move away from IPv4. Therefore, research and tools to assist in the practical transition or migration to new evolved technologies should also be investigated. Significant effort will have to go into understanding and mitigating the many practical aspects of potential transition from the current internet.
Architecture renovation is widely recognised as critically important for the long term vison of NGI, and can provide structural solutions to problems that can only be partially mitigated within the current architecture. NGI Final report advocates the need for catalysing architectural renovation movement.
Why? Rewriting the ground rules of Internet has a huge effect on higher levels. New ways of Internet addressing that prevent spoofing, a distinct possibility with IPv4, should make it impossible to subsequently brute force attacks. This would for instance change the whole dynamics of currently persistent threats – such as distributed denial of service by botnets. Similar changes can be envisioned to address other key issues such as mass surveillance capabilities. Modern usage is completely different from the static setup of those days, and key features such as disruption tolerance should not be an afterthought. Research into infrastructure renovation is essential to facilitate the introduction of exciting new capabilities apart from mitigating existing limitations. The more fundamental the new characteristics, the further we may evolve the internet.
How? Projects within this banner should investigate fundamental contributions to solving the internet’s challenges. They may question the whole technology stack, the only condition being that they are feasible in terms of technology roll-out and prove their potential to provide lasting answers in line with the NGI Vision. In some cases it will be possible to retrofit novel principles into today’s internet, or to encapsulate current behaviour as an application of the future architecture. In other cases this will be wholly impossible or extremely inefficient. In that case, creating forward compatibility by for instance providing suitable abstractions and mechanisms at the level of end points could be helpful.
Apart from addressing the existential threats from the NGI threat catalogue, potential higher level design goals for alternative infrastructures should be-
Confidentiality and privacy
Auditable integrity
Scope isolation of contingencies
Redundancy and self-repair
Disruption tolerance
Smarter asset distribution
Better real-time behaviour
Energy efficiency
Without the movement for Internet architecture renovation, following risks are identified.
Loss of innovation capabilities and competiveness due to unnecessary technological dependencies.
Raising the overall cost of future upgrades to the core technologies of the internet (technical debt).
Loss of diversity, privacy, autonomy and choice for users.
Giving way to alternative next generation internet technologies incompatible with European values.
The entire Internet threat catalogue.
Improvements to the system have been proposed and even implemented with various degrees of maturity and success over the course of decades. For the architectural renovation to be effective for NGI, infrastructure innovations should take into account how they should be introduced or retrofitted at internet scale. This means technologies should not just exist in a paper, a technical specification at the IETF, or run on an infrastructure test bed in a lab. Their claims and compatibility should be tested in every possible situation in an automated manner. Investing in maintainability is vital to achieve that means – without a strong global deployment strategy inside operating systems, routers and management software, alternative infrastructures do not stand a chance. In addition to such deployments, providing adequate fallback mechanisms is a priority.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,07 May 2018,"NGI Interim Study Report recognizes smarter assets distribution as one of the traits for an improved alternative Internet infrastructure. Provisioning distributed alternatives to obtaining digital assets from a single source would make the next generation Internet more robust in the event of various threats, outbreaks and downtimes. These measures would prevent complete service failure, and contribute to making Internet less forgetful, allowing content that would otherwise have disappeared to remain available. Given the common and transverse nature of this issue critical to and effecting all actors from service-providers, ISPs to clients, alternatives complementary to each other therefore should be developed and provisioned in parallel-

Server initiated
	The service that offers the assets can itself suggest or provide a suitable means of taking care of distributed delivery in case of failure.


P2P
	End-to-end sharing of assets with known friendly peers works even in the most extreme scenarios.


Community Caching
	P2P sharing is not scalable, collaborative caching and sharing of assets instead should be able to provide similar benefits and in a scalable manner. An important requirement is that the sharing facilities shield of the privacy of the participants in the network through a level of indirectness, i.e. caching should not mean that the participants you connect with have interacted with that resources themselves.


Network caching
	The operator of the network may prefetch assets likely to be consumed within the network when there is surplus capacity, in order to prevent peak usage


Service-provider driven
	Independent service providers (such as VPN providers) may provide a fall-back service.


Client-side asset identification
	Efficient de-duplication so that a generic asset already cached or downloaded can be identified and reused over and over again.

There are a number of ongoing and relevant smaller and larger initiatives that may contribute to the goal of alternative infrastructure, such as the SCION architecture, ARPA2, DPDK and Open Optical Packet Transport.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,06 May 2018,"Alternatives to current legacy core infrastructure have to be developed in order to structurally increase resilience and robustness of Internet at a systemic level. This would provide an opportunity for fixing Internet's known fundamental architectural weaknesses and applying lessons learned in the lowest possible layer, resultantly, the whole dynamics of currently considered undefeatable threats such as distributed denial of service by botnets and mass surveillance can be changed as well providing a lasting answer from the catalogue of threats dangerous to Internet resiliency. Another benefit is in the high availability of Internet services, be it network or application related. Therefore, the NGI goal should be to ensure high availability, resilience, openness and disruption tolerance by providing a resilient, robust and secure routing and transport layer.
NGI Study Reports recognize alternative core infrastructure with following traits/components to be a feature of Next Generation Internet. A primary challenge for these innovations would be to evolve from testbed and technical specification form, and be deployed in a realistic manner. Improving Maintainability and Deployability is therefore vital to achieve that means – without a strong global deployment strategy inside operating systems, routers and management software, alternative infrastructures do not stand a chance.
Partitioning/scope isolation
	The ability to segment parts of the network in such a way that issues in one part have no side effects in other parts, which would allow for uninterrupted use outside of any affected areas.
	 

Redundancy
	Multiple independent alternatives should be provided to avoid quality degradation and single points of failure. For instance, ubiquitously combining multiple user access networks in parallel, a practice generally referred to as multihoming.
	 


Abuse Handling
	An important part of maintaining high availability is streamlining and automating how incidents are detected and handled across the network, especially in strongly connected parts or functions. Such a practice would make the overall system more secure because it allows for increased responsiveness to changing operational conditions, particularly in time of emergency.
	 


Rooting out spoofing and amplification attacks
	Internet is not very immune to attacks and with minimum efforts can be weaponised to attack itself, citing an amplification attack example that old Internet protocols are still in common usage which will happily answer every request with a response over 4000 times larger. Spoofing therefore has to be kept out from NGI as it provides attackers a huge advantage over those that have to keep their systems up and running.
	 


Smarter asset distribution (less fragile and invasive)
	Distributed alternatives to obtaining digital assets from a single source should be provided to make the NGI more robust in the context of various threats, outbreaks and downtimes. Given the common and transverse nature of this issue critical to and affecting all actors from service-providers and ISPs to clients, complementary alternatives therefore should be developed and provisioned in parallel. This could be from the server-end through means like geo-distributedness, through network or service-provider means such as CDN and VPN, or at client-side through caching and providing alternative native as well as 3rd party software to access web resources as discussed in detail in this discussion.

There are a number of ongoing and relevant smaller and larger initiatives that may contribute to the goal of alternative infrastructure, such as the SCION architecture, ARPA2, DPDK and Open Optical Packet Transport.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,12 Mar 2018,"Flexibility and responsiveness is essential for Internet as a system. Without proper procedures for maintenance and without auditability, a system cannot be expected to be secure and reliable. Internet should be made responsive to changing conditions, support efficient deployment of upgrades, particularly in the event of disastrous system failure, performance degradation, changes in workload, or conditions of crisis etc., as advocated by the NGI Interim Study report. The systems should also be equipped with periodic self-test procedures in order to check the system’s integration and immunity against various malicious attacks.
Deployability means that it should be possible to easily distribute and combine new technologies in order to deploy them. A shared delivery methodology for software produced for and required by the NGI will allow the user to easily and instantly switch back and forth between different versions of both software and dependencies. It would also create a shared workflow across all of the NGI projects where one may consistently apply best practices such as continuous integration, code fuzzing and the creation of integrated test suites. The results and failures, as well as collisions across projects, for instance when two projects are working on incompatible patches to an operating system kernel in exactly the same place, would become immediately visible to anyone. These are but a few starting points, the overall goal is to converge systems and to create the distributed capability to make appropriate near-runtime modifications in the event of catastrophic system failure, degradation of performance, change in workload, and conditions of crisis.
NGI Interim and final reports recognize the need for R&D efforts to be deployable and maintainable in the context of actual Internet environment. A successful approach for NGI would be to create a universal and reliable path to automatable deployment even during development. The aim would be having a coordinated approach to get the needed deployments and upgrades on the Next Generation Internet by using realistic transition mechanisms, solving scalability issues, collecting feedback by real time data gathering, and encouraging the right network equipment upgrade capabilities and emergency response procedures. The goal is to ensure resilience, reliability, trustworthiness and sustainability of the NGI. The benefits of a maintainable Internet and increased deployability of NGI projects are-
With a coordinated deployment strategy comes increased reusability of efforts and sharing of knowledge arises and beyond projects. Without that, there is a risk that NGI projects would not benefit from each other’s results, and not able to deal with overarching issues.
Lower costs at the project level by shared infrastructure and setups, otherwise subprojects inside NGI will each invent different quality procedures and delivery.
Prolonged unavailability cannot be prevented due to lack of a shared upgrade mechanism across NGI subproject. Thus a coordinated upgrade strategy will increase the efficiency of the overall infrastructure.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,12 Mar 2018,"The internet needs to be extremely resilient and should be able to cope with many parts of the modern threat landscape. The IETF believes “Whenever a new protocol is developed or existing protocols are modified, threats to their security should be evaluated”, (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4081.txt).  
Different threat categories were identified by the NGI Interim Study report which need to be considered in order to achieve the vision of NGI, grouped together as 'Force majeure' (Natural disaster, Man-made disasters, Adversary AI), 'Technological’ (Cascade of system failure, Spillover from inadequate isolation/segmentation), and ‘Human intent’ (Cyber warfare and cyber conflicts, Industrial espionage, Industrial sabotage, Pervasive surveillance and Malicious big data). Here is a brief overview of different threat categories:​​​​​​​

Natural disaster: Damage to critical parts of the infrastructure (earthquakes, floods).


Man-made disasters: Intentional and unintentional sabotage, the result of human action, (nuclear explosions, acts of terrorism, vandalism).


Adversary AI: AI does not understand mutually assured destruction. The risk of non-benevolent or adversary AI to impact the larger system becomes more realistic as AI is handed larger responsibilities, such as handling some of the largest data centres on the planet, (https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/).


Cascade of system failure: Many resources on the web and the wider internet are no longer self-contained, but have hard-coded dependencies on resources delivered by third parties, such as content delivery networks and cloud providers. These are used for critical features such as navigation. An outage somewhere in this chain can ripple an avalanche of unintended outages throughout many different systems. 


Spillover from inadequate isolation/segmentation: The combination of different applications and user domains in a single infrastructure mean that the risks of that combined system may end up as the sum of all risks. One submission pointed out a quote by a security manager: “In a relatively short time we've taken a system built to resist destruction by nuclear weapons and made it vulnerable to toasters.” (Jeff Jarmoc, head of security Salesforce, quoted in a summary article at http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37738823).


Cyber warfare and cyber conflicts: The Fifth Domain, disruption of the internet infrastructure of a region for military and political purposes.  


Industrial espionage: Theft of advanced technology from industry, academia and military through exploiting internet infrastructure weaknesses.


Industrial sabotage: Disruption and exploitation of internet weaknesses aimed at competing global regions and economic actors, aimed at giving the attacker a competitive edge.


Pervasive surveillance: Mass scale monitoring and long term programmes for pervasive surveillance dating back to the earliest days of the internet have been exposed and not all capabilities have been revealed.


Malicious big data: Passive observation of users by companies without their explicit knowledge and consent is another type of threat.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,19 Feb 2018,"In human history, we always tried to reach for the sky. In construction, the foundation is the most important part of the building. Because of its unstable foundation, the leaning tower of Pisa started to sink at the second floor and it took three phases over 199 years to complete. It has had numerous very costly structural renovations during its lifetime, and the straightening of the tower from 5.5 to 3.9 degrees completed in 2013 costed $30m dollars.
The ancient Egyptians used their knowledge and past experiences to build the great pyramid in less than 20 years. It was the tallest building in the world for over 3800 years until 1311 and it structural integrity is still intact today

The same applies to computer networks. Nearly half a century old, 4 layered TCP/IP design was sufficient enough to fulfil the needs of that time.

The internet nowadays is built upon the same TCP/IP stack which has proved to have an inadequate core architectural design for the scale it has grown into. To solve the emerging problems, more and more building blocks were added and a very complex solution is the current result. Today’s Internet is it has bad performances, bad security, hard to build and maintain, and configuration and operational costs are through the roof. In this respect, TCP/IP is not unlike our leaning tower of Pisa.

Most of the services which we are using today e.g. security, QoS etc. are not built-in. It is obvious that the NGI initiative for a human centric network will insert many more services in already overweight layered stack. Thus creating new vulnerabilities and the game will go on. For example, in order to overcome the address depletion problem and to facilitate the ever increasing number of Internet users, IPv6 is brought into network however IPv6 has it's own issues such as exploding routing table size.
There is a need for such an architecture that is more scalable, robust and has built-in services like security and QoS. Users and service providers should have the freedom to opt-in or opt-out any service at any time without disturbing the any other user or underlying protocols.

H2020 2019 call topic n3 - Open Internet Architecture Renovation,18 Jan 2018,"HUB4NGI D2.1 identifies some key application areas which are expected to be greatly impacted by the emerging NGI technologies.
Industry 4.0
Industry 4.0 is a big change as agreed by the experts in ""The Next Generation Internet Workshop"" on ""Widen the European Space of Life and Work"" held on 8th June 2017. It is considered to be the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector. It relies on Internet services and knowledge is largely shared across the network in order to exploit this available knowledge for faster and better robotic learning.
Immersive Environment
With the advancement in AI and learning algorithms, the immersive environments such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) are also expected to be leveraged. However, these new forms of interactions and immersive environments might also face the challenges of data privacy, diversity and the concentration of data into proprietary platforms. Understanding the psychological & biological effects and threats and opportunities for industry and citizens is necessary in the VR world.
Collective User Experience
Decentralised, heterogeneous and distributed architectures are important in the next generation digital society. For an enhanced user experience, human-centric technologies need to be identified, propagated and managed.  
Lifelong Learning
ICT lifelong learning is important in order to raise people's awareness of the significance of acquiring ICT skills throughout their lives.
Inclusiveness
Each citizen has the right to benefit from modern ICT services and technologies. And the services should be designed in simple and easy to use way so that everyone including persons with disabilities could get benefit. Ubiquitous access to Internet and other ICT services is the right of each citizen just like access to clean water or energy infrastructure. Inclusiveness and ubiquitous connection are the key themes for civil society.
The important risk factor is the potential isolation of those behind general levels of connectivity. There is a need to take immediate actions in order to bridge the digital divides and to cope with the digital literacy challenges.
Protection from the dangers of the Internet
Ordinary Internet users are not fully aware how deep they are in the Internet. They sometimes disclose very personal information against social engineering attacks. This poses not only data protection problem but also people themselves protection. It is important for emerging NGI technologies to protect people from dangers of the Internet.

The convergence among these technologies such as 5G, SDN, AI, and NFV is highly important. The NGI infrastructure and architecture will have significant challenges of low latency, higher throughput and secure communication, therefore the development of new network protocols should be the core of future R&D efforts. Because of the new networking approaches, and higher demand of interoperability, security may be built within the networking protocol.
HUB4NGI D2.1 identifies following technologies as important for NGI and gathers the citations for each of these.
Internet of Things (IOT):
IoT is marked as the top technology driver by the number of sources. From the results of a large scale survey of European citizens, IoT, Big Data and machine learning are considered to be the most promising technologies which may have larger impact not only on peoples' personal lives but also in the labour market.
At the Digital Innovation Networks (DIN) Forum held on 27 June 2017, from the opinions expressed by experts, almost 80% of participants expressed IoT as the key technology driver for NGI.
Blockchain & Distributed Ledgers
Although still not very familiar to most people, however, blockchain and distributed ledgers are widely being considered as revolutionary technologies. At the Next Generation Internet workshop - ""Widen the European space of life and work"" held on 8 June 2017, it was highly recommended that we have to adapt and understand blockchain technology and for this purpose training is very important. A research on better compression algorithms is also very important to make this technology more efficient.
The participants in a large scale survey expressed the potential for a financial revolution from these technologies. At the Digital Innovation Networks (DIN) Forum held on 27 June 2017, the experts agreed that a pan European blockchain should be included in the new areas of research and experimentation such as IoT programmability, robotic devices, large scale streams etc.
Big Data
Big Data is also seen by the European citizens as the most promising next generation technology.
Edge Computing
Edge Computing is considered as top-priority technology area by 30% experts at the Digital Innovation Networks Forum held on 27 June 2017.
AI and Autonomous Machines
Autonomous machines, as defined in the Digital Innovation Networks (DIN) Forum in 2017, are intelligent self-driven machines (robots) that are capable to sense their surrounding environment, reason intelligently about it, and take actions to perform tasks in cooperation with humans and other machines in a wide variety of situations on land, sea and air.
With the development and proliferation of autonomous machines, a paradigm shift will occur within the Industrial IoT domains towards Edge Computing, in which programmable, autonomous IoT end-devices can communicate with one another and continue to operate without connectivity.
Artificial Intelligence and autonomous machines are expected to have major impact on our society. With the advancement of machine learning, AI will play an increased role in our daily life (e.g. self-driven cars, semi-automated justice systems etc.).
Open Data
Discoverable and easy to process data is important from the perspective of start-ups. There is a need to develop and ""open link"" in order to overcome the challenges of format interoperability among data representation and data sources.
Cloud Computing
Although cloud computing pose some security and privacy threats however it is important because of many reasons. For both education and business, cloud solutions are seen as a great opportunity. In order to overcome the challenges of security, privacy and surveillance, new security built protocols could be designed to support new business and social domains.

Wrong! Your movements can be followed through tracking tools but do the app developers really need to track your location? Absolutely not. This is just one of many examples of design by deception as Kai Rannenberg, Chair of Mobile Business and Multilateral Security at Goethe University, pointed out at ICT2018. 
In a nutshell, today’s app markets are not informing us of what they track or when. Users have no way to check this behaviour. To turn things around, we need improvements on several levels:
1. Trustworthy hardware.
2. Robust mobile operating systems.
3. Privacy-friendly apps giving users control.
4. Better app markets informing users better about the apps and the consequences of using them.
5. Neutral evaluation of relevant system properties so the average person can understand and make informed choices. 
We need to create a world where every citizen can understand privacy settings and their implications. A ""trustworthy communicator"", including an app market that informs the citizen-consumer is informed about data flows and security levels.
Consent forms are very long lists and hardly anybody reads the terms and conditions. These conditions are expected to change for apps with the GDPR and ePrivacy laws in Europe, but we need much more debate on how technologies are developed and related business cases.

NGI in Austria: focusing funding on societal and legal developments in sync with technology developments
Oliver Hoffman, Austrian Ministry for Infrastructure, presented the recent national calls in relation to NGI topics. It is recognised that the projects not only address technology developments, but must also focus on societal and legal developments. It is well known that the latter lags behind technology’ developments, so the motivation in our calls is to better synchronise those developments from the very start. Thus, the funding on national level in Austria focuses on the inter-disciplinary nature of NGI challenges. If you have a technology innovation, the legal and social motivation might not be there and need ramping up and included from the start. Austria had a first call on this in 2017, entitled ICT of the Future with a funding of €500, 000 - these are the projects presented during the ICT2018 Networking Session. In 2018,  funding has increased to €700,000.

Subtitle of LEDGER is “The Venture Builder for Human centric solutions”. More info will soon be available at http://www.ledgerproject.eu. Some information is already available at http://ngi.eu/opencalls/. The concept is to have 32 projects covering topics like privacy by Design, Open software, as well as decentralised technologies such as blockchain, peer to peer, and distributed ledger technologies.

Katrin Mathmann – Foodnetlab project: using NGI approaches for the food industry, which is quite conservative and needs to be brought into NGI systematically so it can benefit from NGI technologies in the future. The project only started 8 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago held its first focus group meeting with 50 industry partners, mainly from Austria and from producers, feeders, breeders, retail, and network. The next stage is to include government players, policy makers, plants. A survey will ask people in companies to rate the impact factors of NGI from their perspective. In the next step colleagues will make a “game” to show society and get feedback on how citizens see see it, telling us acceptance levels and how much it is liked. This concept will then be turned into an innovation laboratory in Austria, where people from the network can co-create new projects for the food industry. NGI plays a key role in giving the big picture and on how co-creation can be effective.

The project wants to see if the societal values can be translated into the business values. http://compass-project.at/. The project wants to see if they can make new products based on these values, and ensure a transparent process. They also want to bring it to the policy makers so they can use the knowledge as part of the decision making process for future funding. 
Expedite project: Exploring Opportunities and challenges for Emerging personal Data Ecosystems: Empowering humans in the age of the GDPR – a roadmap for Austria.  We need a paradigm shift to get the data out of the silos and figure out how to better use data to benefit society. Small companies face challenges with the GDPR. Expedite is a roadmap that will lead to further projects later on. The project is multi-dimensional and will work with social scientists, technologists, lawyers, etc. to determine the new opportunities on how to use data in a way that benefits humans and understand what kind of support is needed to fully realise these benefits.
Christoher Frauenberger, TU Vienna Winner of the NGI Research & Education Award. Christoher is part of the COMPASS project, motivating his application to the NGI award.  His work is looking at the deep connectivity between the data economy situation and how it needs to be re-thought of at all different levels. Research will tap into the many resources of Aarhus University, where they have many experts in the necessary mullti-disciplinary fields and he is very grateful for the opportunity being offered by winning the NGI award.
Mirko Presser described the next round of the NGI Awards. Aarhus University is very much looking forward to hosting the winners and bringing NGI technologies and social elements to real life. It will be very cross cutting at Aarhus University, involving technologies, sociologists, legal experts, etc. This dimension is very much reflected in the winners of the last round of the awards. This is expected to continue with the next round of NGI Awards being run again by NGI Forward project in 2019. You are welcome to apply for this!

NGI @ICT2018,29 Nov 2018,"Public and consortium blockchains are widely considered to be disruptive innovations by enabling new market and low-end market footholds.
Consortium networks can be the preferred blockchain architecture for businesses because they enable partners to retain control of certain rights while reaping the benefits of a decentralised network. 
But what kind of business model can support blockchain innovations? Well, the decentralised focus of blockchains means that traditional centralised business model canvases are not really fit for purpose. Blockchain will also have multi-dimensional impacts on the four dimensions of business models to unleash new opportunities. 
Out with the old - in with the new. Some key aspects to consider:
1. Blockchain can enable increased operational efficiency, the removal of intermediaries in transactions, micro-economics, crowdfunding, digital ownership and authentication of assets.
2. Blockchain's democratising effects can empower users and create a shift in power structures between providers and users.
3. Users can be increasingly engaged in both value creation and the infrastructure needed for value delivery.
4. Blockchain can change the role of trust. Businesses need to have a greater focus on customer relationships.

Hate speech is fuelling discrimination and intolerance across the internet and society.
Disinformation, malinformation and misinformation are eroding trust in internet users and creating fast-emerging risks.
We need to level the playing field and protect our European human values.
Europe is driving discussions on these and similar issues in a debate that is open and evidence-based to ensure diversity of information, freedom of speech and privacy as a fundamental human right. EuroDIG 2018 is offering an important forum for debate.
Many studies are taking place across Europe and the Council of Europe is setting down recommendations but actions are need to help citizens make more informed decisions about how they how use the internet. Citizens also need to be able to read information critically with digital literacy initiatives in place across all member states.
Technology innovations like blockchain, artificial intelligence and cognitive algorithms are important in implementing a pre-emptive approach by enabling faster identification of content verification.
But we also need a coordinated international response to these challenges, bringing together civil society, the private sector and the technical community to work towards a framework of voluntary practices, more research to understand the problems and the risks, citizen guidance to help differentiate between fact and fiction.

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,06 May 2018,"Typically Internet users do not possess much understanding of security issues and ways to protect oneself as user. There is also lack of trust in technology that hinders economic growth. There is a need to develop standard interaction patterns to allow declarative interaction. By standardising popular interaction patters, users only have to passively declare the desired interaction, and do not have to bother the user with permission to run unverifiable scripts on a web page. The users will have the right to be off-line when using connected devices, as well as using safe content profiles or generic profiles for revealing personal information. This will lead to higher openness and trustworthiness of the Internet with the effect of enabling innovation and creativity.
Safe Content Profiles
	For the end users, safe content profiles need to be implemented. The original design of the web as a set of documents where one can safely surf from link to link, has been lost over time due to the rise of demanding applications that appropriated the technology to get system agnostic interfaces. As a result, document are now no longer safe. When a user browses an unknown website, he or she typically grants the operator the same technical privileges as a bank or trusted software supplier would need – browser have not been given the native abilities to distinguish among known and unknown. Browsing the internet, the risk of abuse is very significant. Availability of a safe content profile (e.g.. return of the web document) would provide a subset of features that is known to be secure and passive, which would guarantee the end users are not attacked while they just want to read a document.
	 
Domain Isolation
	Domain isolation, which is another part of the securing the browser environment, should be provided between websites. This will minimize the amount of observational data about a user between their use of different websites  unless the user explicitly makes the connection. There is a real need for users to be in control of what the application software inside their device and the sensors are revealing about them to the outside, such as their location or life habits. There is a need to provide generic profiles for revealing personal information. A user should be able to silence or randomise sensors, or to have his GPS module give inaccurate data about his whereabouts to app that do not need such intimate information
	 
Hardware security
	Hardware should also be protected from abusive monitoring. There should be mandatory hard switches for embedded cameras and other devices. Cameras and microphones are particularly invasive, and a high profile target for abuse. Users should be able to physically switch of cameras and microphones they are not using, so that they can be 100% safe from the emergence of sudden software flaws or security glitches. Furthermore, users should have the right to be IoT off-line including environment. People should not be forced to use invasive technologies by their employer or other persons that have authority over them. Encryption is the single most important technological building block of Internet security. The rigjht to encryption should also be universally established.

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,04 May 2018,"Everyone has the right to deserve respect for his or her private life, home and communications. Trust is the key driver for human interaction. Identity and reputation are characteristics which should be an intrinsic part of the internet infrastructure, yet any such unbiased shared infrastructure is lacking. Market-driven mechanisms in this already are opaque and predatory, and tend to reinforce already problematic market imbalance and unfairness. In addition, these produce undesirable side efects such as passive profiling and exposure to corporate surveillance. In order to secure end-user rights, the NGI needs to create decentralised internet-wide identity mechanisms, distributed reputation options and ensuring viable means of extending end-of-life of software and software-enabled devices. A better protection of users starts with the ability to distinguish users from each other. The goal is to improve the trustworthiness of the Internet and the sustainability of software and devices making use of it, which builds the levels of trust for the Internet to be levered in innovation.
Furthermore, there is a need to look for the alternatives of naming system.The DNS system is known to leak a lot of detail about the behaviour of users to third parties, including public DNS operators and wifi hotspot operators (and since these are known to be very unsafe, to anyone). DNS is regularly used as a tool of censorship and in some cases surveillance. A dual strategy of hardening at the one end and shifing to fundamentally more secure and private solutions at the other is recommended.

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,16 Mar 2018,"Today cooperation of good guys against the brotherhood of hackers is fragmented rather than a principle. Too often companies and other entities are reluctant (for good reasons) to share security related information. Prevailing principle is: what is inside my walls is my business, the rest of the Internet including my customers, does not concern me. Plus everyone handles security patching themselves, or leaves it until later. No surprise that most security breaches take place using known vulnerabilties for which patches exist. The hackers can keep on using the same resources agaist many potential victims.
To change the picture, in www.re2ee.org we are proposing a solution made of several components
- cooperative firewalling (customer edge switching)
- realm gateway for interoperation with the legacy Internet
- ubiquitous policy based admission of all flows
- homomorphic trust processing in trust domains (correponds to gossipping behind the back of people in society)
Here communications security policy = desciption of what a host expects. Policy creation should be as automatic as we can make it.
The approach has numerous benefits like: no unwanted traffic is sent over the air to wireless hosts, NAT traversal is dynamic (ICE is only a fall back option) leads to fast and easy session setup, all security logic is at the edge leading to better scalability, better use of private addressing improving overall network scaling, limiting the actions it makes sense for hackers to program into exploits, fast traceback of all resources used by attacks, limiting the lifetime of those infected resources, scaling of the firewall itself due to use of SDN principles in the design etc...

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,12 Mar 2018,"Internet is the fabric of modern communication. Privacy and confidentiality are essential human rights - at the heart of both the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights. People entrust their most private and intimate information to travel safely across the internet - to their loved ones, to journalists, politicians and lawmakers. Governments and businesses trust critical parts of their operations to the internet. The shocking revelations from whistle-blowers like Edward Snowden have made it very clear that this shared trust in the internet has been naive and undeserved, and that weak parts of the design of the internet have being systematically abused at a scale beyond comprehension. It has become very clear that the internet was - knowingly - kept incapable of handling the actual threats since the earliest days of the internet, which has put the world at risk. The ground work for pervasive surveillance now serves industrial espionage, cybercrime, and sabotage - and who knows what else. Technologies driven by data hunger rather than user needs have made the web unsafe. 
The NGI initiative wants to create an Internet that deals with this severe crisis in the only way possible: move on and fix it. An internet that is non-partisan, and at its very core serves shared human values. NGI seeks to craft an internet that is resilient, trustworthy and sustainable. Part of that is preventing any systematic leaks of metadata and communication profiling of users. The following aspects related to NGI activities on confidentiality have so far been suggested and brought out by the NGI Interim Study report-

Routing Layer Confidentiality: The routing layer of TCP/IP Internet architecture is vulnerable against man-in-the-middle attack and passive observation. The communication pattern can be exposed even when common end-to-end encryption is used. There are known solutions to this vulnerability and need to be further investigated and developed for more confidentiality.


Naming System Hardening and Alternatives: The current Domain Name System (DNS) system is also vulnerable to leak user activities and behaviours to third parties. DNS is regularly used as a tool of censorship and in some cases surveillance. A dual strategy of hardening at the one end and shifting to fundamentally more secure solutions at the other is recommended.


Search and Discovery: One of the most problematic areas for confidentiality is search and discovery. Current search tools have shown that they leak a great deal of private information about users.


Provide end-user security transparency: Not every connection is the same. Users should be able to grasp the overall security situation of a specific connection.


Protecting users from malicious data observation: Passive observation of users by companies without their explicit knowledge and consent, which includes storing the complete browsing history of users, location data, media consumption, shopping behaviour, cross-device identification of users, stealth identification of other users in the vicinity, undisclosed audio streaming for off-site analysis, persistent identifiers, etc.


Develop new safe web standards: As security attacks like Rowhammer, Meltdown and Spectre prove, allowing to running unverified software on web pages poses a dire risk to the user. By standardising popular interaction patterns, users only have to passively declare the desired interaction, and do not have to bother the user with permission to run unverifiable scripts on a web page.

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,21 Feb 2018,"Cybersecurity will be the most pressing challenge of the next decade. Inadequate management of cyber threats will put users increasingly at risk, undermine trust in the Internet and jeopardise its ability to act as a driver for economic and social innovation. Disproportionate government responses will threaten freedoms, and contribute to a climate of fear and uncertainty. The ISOC report on “Paths to Our Digital Future” released in 2017 brought attention to the fact that we need new models to increase cybersecurity readiness and reduce vulnerabilities but also to ensure end-user security. The complexity and scope of cyberattacks necessitates multi-stake holder and expertise-driven responses for the digital economy to thrive and for trust in the Internet to be rebuilt.
The scale of cyberattacks is steadily growing, and many anticipate the likelihood of catastrophic cyberattacks in the future.
As the Internet becomes intertwined with national security, cyber offense and defence strategies will shape the future Internet for industry and individual users alike. Acts of cyber conflict will be coupled with disinformation and propaganda to destabilise states and economies. The threat of destructive cyber conflict will only increase over the next decade. Conflicts will be initiated not only by nation states, but also by their surrogates, and by independent political movements and private actors. For the open Internet to continue as a platform for social and economic growth, users must be able to trust that the government agencies and businesses collecting and using their data are resilient and will address cybersecurity threats adequately. 
Neither government nor the private sector can deal with the scope and scale of cyber threats alone. Driven by the need to be seen to be “doing something” in the face of ever-bolder cyberattacks, we expect that government responses to cybersecurity challenges will be increasingly reactive. Effective action and building network resilience towards cyber threats will only come through information sharing, strategic thinking and collaborative efforts among stakeholders. 
The way stakeholders adapt to future cyberattacks could change the Internet from an open and collaborative Internet to a fragmented, closed but “secure” network environment. 
The pressure to put “rules of the road” in place will continue, but it is unclear whether governments will prioritise cross-border cooperation over national sovereignty and security. Financial markets, elections and health care provision will not be immune to cyberattacks and cybercrime in the future.

The ISOC report on “Paths to Our Digital Future” released in 2017 highlighted this issue. As networks and traffic streams become increasingly complex, AI can help network managers to understand traffic patterns and create heuristics that identify security threats. At a basic enterprise level, AI can perform tasks normally carried out by an IT helpdesk, such as troubleshooting employee computer problems. In this way the IT professionals will get more time to implement security best practices and better secure their systems and networks.
As the AI needs large amount of computational resources and data, because of that, it is possible that the computing and storage resource need to be redistributed to meet the requirements of the technology which could also impact on the Internet architecture.

The focus was on the need to understand the trust, security and privacy concerns within NGI regarding the interaction of humans and autonomous, manual and remotely operated machines.

More urgency is needed on this. 
Will end-users know the how much privacy, if any they could have when using a service? Should open source software be checked by NGO’s, trusted parties? Should a decentralised trust be set up? The dominance of social networks begs the questions, should they be broke up? Should they pay for content? Are citizens informed, do they understand what social networks do with their content?

Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies,15 Jan 2018,"One of the topics raised in the Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable that is worth discussing further, is a lack of control over Data.
There is a considerable fear that citizens’ privacy is being eroded by the exploitation of citizens’ personal data by profiling, and citizens have no control over this. At the DIN Forum 2017 there was concern that the dominators of the Internet economy; Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, are using and selling our personal data.
According to the Lipparini & Romeo  there are a lot of conversations about preserving net neutrality and equal access to the Internet, or making sure that user privacy, security, and data ownership are preserved, and that data based profiling doesn’t result in manipulation of people or the democratic process. Once you give you're data to a provider, it is out of your control. Exacerbating this problem is the fear around the difficulties encountered when citizens want to manage their privacy. Even when citizens know where their data has been processed, it is not easy to exert any control over how the processing is done, or to prevent processing. 
There is a strong feeling about the right to know who had collected your personal data and who controls it. The need for all EU countries to formalise this through legal channels was discussed in Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Centre, The Next Generation Internet workshop - Widen the European space of life and work.

Discovery and Identification Technologies,26 Sep 2018,"At the NGIForum 2018, Prof. Jamal Shahin (VUB and GIPO) led this discussion on tackling online disinformation.
Prof. Shahin represented the weight of the disinformation crisis by citing an example of how some kids believed that Titanic was burnt upon watching an Youtube video. In the wake of this, Prof. Shahin presented some illuminating statistics, only 2% of children have the critical literacy skills they need to tell if a news story is real or fake, half of teachers (53.5%) believe that the national curriculum does not equip children with the literacy skills they need to identify fake news. Two broad questions to handle this issue were raised - What critical skills do we need to have to overcome disinformation? and what tools do we need to overcome disinformation in the NGI?.
A number of challenges related to tackling online disinformation were presented - Skills (digital literacy); how to reach out into the Public sphere and the news media ecosystem; tools, techniques and algorithms required for overcoming disinformation; and where does the liability or responsibilty lies.
Prof. Shahin also involved the audience of NGIForum in an interesting poll about how to face online disinformation. A number of answers were recorded from the participants on the following possible solutions:
• Through self-regulation (5.2 /10);
• Through support to quality journalism (7.7 /10);
• Through regulation (5.0 /10);
• Through education (8.7 /10);
• Non-intervention – the marketplace of ideas will deal with it (2.8 /10).

Discovery and Identification Technologies,26 Sep 2018,"At the NGIForum 2018, a workshop was organized on Better search for trustworthy content and objects discovery. Mr. Aleš Černivec, (Project Manager, XLAB d.o.o.) led this discussion session on tools and concepts for search and discovery based on the Slovenian Interoperability Framework. 
XLAB d.o.o. ( a Slovenian company) has gained significant experiences in building knowledge management services and portals. They built the Slovenian interoperability portal hat allows public authorities (PAs) to publish their solutions and make them discoverable to citizens. Legislation and openness of public sectors data allows citizens to look in to PAs operations and better trust them. Citizens have the means to develop new solutions based on searchable and existing information at their ready disposal. The institutions producing the data thus also become more aware of their responsibility leading to the improvement in data quality, quantity and management. The portal contributes to  Slovenian open data portal which provides a single point of access for easier search, analysis and linking of the data.
Mr. Černivec presented on search and discovery tools from the perspective of the Slovenian interoperability and open data portal, in particular covering security, ID management, authentication and authorisation frameworks, data sharing and safeguarding privacy. The presentation focussed on the technologies involved and also highlighted the human values to be considered while developing these technologies. The human values of importance to this topic include openness, trust, security, revision (transparency), and responsibility. In words of Mr. Černivec,
Experiences gained show that the technology allows us to manage the knowledge easier and faster, produce new content faster; and human values can now be powered by the technology and Next Generation Internet should make knowledge management easier, more dynamic, discoverable.”

Discovery and Identification Technologies,25 Sep 2018,"At the NGIForum 2018, Mr. Alexandru Stan from In-Two, Germany provided the viewpoint of SMEs in relation to their participation to the Next Generation Internet initiative (NGI):  Are SMEs important for NGI? Can SMEs create the impact in trustworthiness of content alone?
Speaking on the first question, the importance of the role of SMEs in the NGI initiative was especially highlighted since they have a critical role to play in the value chain of innovation, in which they are constantly experimenting, and rapidly bringing new innovative things to the market. They are well positioned and have a guided view on how to design solutions that are “People centric” and “human centric”, as to succeed as an SME, it is necessary to come up with real solutions that make sense to solving real world problems.
In response to the second question, it was felt that SMEs do not play well alone. Researchers need the collaboration with SMEs in order to make their innovation an industrial success. Industry can push the innovation process behind research organizations. Mr. Stan highlighted the Marconi project for an example of excellent collaboration between research and industry, in particular SMEs, within the combined fields of radio & media. IN2 is an SME working on developing content-rich applications with trustworthiness and quality of content, and collaboration with research institutes for them provided stimulating results, according to Mr. Stan.
Human Values, Challenges, Solutions, Initiatives, Gaps and R&I needs related to Search and Discovery (SME perspective) are presented below.
The following Human Values were identified in relation to this topic

V1. Openness;
V2. Access;
V3. Inclusiveness;
V4. Trustworthiness.

The following Challenges were identified in relation to these Human values

C1. The trend of moving towards echo chambers and walled gardens, and how this differs from the ideas of an open internet [V1, V2, V3, V4];
C2. Content without the proper context or content with the wrong context [V4];
C3. The need to raise the profile and reputation of SMEs producing solutions in the larger setting against the large players, who have a dominant role [V3];
C4. Coming up with a peer review or reputation strategy to make it clear to customers that what SMEs are doing is trustworthy [V3, V4]
C5. Trustworthiness for the entire value chain in large scale systems – how to ensure all steps along the way are verifiable in real time (some examples from smart Agriculture, smart pharma were highlighted where if one sensor was giving incorrect readings, the whole system is compromised) [V4].

The participants identified a number of Potential Solutions to address the challenges

S1. Less is More (e.g. “A-Social networks”);
S2. Conversation vs. “Engagement”;
S3. Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (IndieWeb);
S4. Trade off: Convenience / Privacy;
S5. Selective serendipity (i.e. giving the algorithms an opportunity to step out of the models);
S6. Developing transparency into peer to peer reputation systems, making them more trustworthy – connect with experimental platforms such as smart cities initiatives, Fed4Fire, and other experimental facilities would enable raising of profile and reputation of results coming from the NGI programme [C4].

A number of known initiatives / projects were identified addressing the solutions

I1. Caprice community
I2. European Trusted Cloud Platform of EIT Digital; e.g. My Data Store of Telecom Italia. Also see Trusted Cloud Platform with FSecure, experimenting with an offer of Security as a Service (now available commercially HERE). In-Two have integrated this in one of their solutions so that our customers could have secure and trustworthy content hubs, building search and discovery on top of the trusted content only. [C5]

I4. FIWARE context broker, which is a central component of the FIWARE platform, would it address the challenge related to mapping the content and context in relation to the content. [C2]

Identified Gaps

G1. How to make sure the context for the content is correct and evolving? [C2, I4]
G2. Lifespan of the content and whether it is evolving according to the correct contex? Some challenges to address are a) Gaining reputation from today’s models could take too long; b) Need to develop new ways to quicken the process e.g. having reputable review trusted authorities and/ or certification processes. [C2]
G3. Need to look at the end to end harvesting of data to ensure there is no corruption of data anywhere. [C5, S6]

R&I Needs to fill the gaps

R1. Detailing correctness and authenticity of entire value chain verification mechanisms (some work started in smart pharma and smart agri, but much more is needed for NGI); [G3]
R2. Could blockchain technologies be used to address these gaps in such a low power based system: is it feasible, either technically or economically? [G1 – G3]

Discovery and Identification Technologies,25 Sep 2018,"At the NGIForum 2018, a workshop was organized on Better search for trustworthy content and objects discovery. A specfic discussion in the workshop was positioned on how we need new ways of storing, understanding and releasing data based on the semantics of the data itself and the context within which the data exists.
“We have many options how to store our data (cloud, device, edge, NAS). But is it better to rely on local external devices or buy a cloud space somewhere? Imagine you have a heart attack and you need people to access your medical history, where would you like them to go?”
This discussion evolved from the idea that our current means of storing and releasing data lack any insight into the meaning of that data, the context in which it is in use, and reliable set of rules governing how that data can be used or shared given that context in addition to automated mechanisms to enforce those rules.

Discovery and Identification Technologies,04 May 2018,"Enabling unbiased and privacy-respectful discovery of content, services and metadata on the Web, also in a real-time local context. This will lead to higher trustworthiness of the Internet for the users, more openness of content and enhancement of creativity and human potential through alternative access to various types of content andservices.
The internet and especially the web are constantly changing, as billions of people add, shift, modify and remove content and services. To find their way around, internet users heavily depend on a small set of active intermediaries such as search engines, social networks and platforms. This strong dependency carries a number of very signifcant risks:
an intermediary may (either intentionally or non-intentionally) act as a gatekeeper (block certain things),
exhibit an unfair (economical, political, social or other) bias and,
intimately track, analyse and influence user behaviour.
At internet scale, looming dominance of a few large intermediaries is fed back into the decision process during creation and promotion decisions of content and services. This leads to a vicious cycle which reinforces dominance and as such has huge implications for the open nature of the Next Generation Internet. Allowing for bottom-up means of fine-grained discovery as well as shared metadata and other forms of enrichment and aggregation of content and services is essential to create alternatives. By making low-level discoverability an essential characteristic of the edges of the system, rather than something controlled by intermediaries.

Decentralised Data Governance,31 Oct 2018,"At the NGI Forum 2018 in Porto, a session was led by Marta Arniani (futuribile / curating futures) on behalf of the NGI Move project on the topic of ""A secure, decentralised Internet"".
The session consisted of 4 sessions debating on different challenges in making of a decentralised Internet. In one the session, Pablo Ojanguren, founder and CTO of Swell RT spoke on the unbalance of data relationships in the digital market.
The data-based relationships between users (consumers) and companies isn't fair.  
Users don’t really control how their data are delivered to service providers, which gather them through centralized channels (user interface, web or app) and process them.  Also, the information returned by the service can be only consumed in one controlled way. It is like buying shoes that you can only wear in the streets allowed by the vendor.  
	 
 Another case of unbalance is when organizations can handle our information automatically but we cannot handle theirs in the same way.  Should these commercial relationships of data be legally regulated?  Could we legally force service providers to give APIs to allow users to retrieve its data or to decide where its data must be stored?  
What would happen if users could get raw data from service providers? Would that be helpful?  Here is where real decentralization apps can help. A single user couldn’t extract much more value from its data by itself (or service’s data). But people could aggregate their data in a peer-2-peer platform to operate them. In cases like Uber, for example, it would bring opportunity for drivers to be organized in a kind of p2p digital union driven by data that could allow better self regulation.

The following priorities for a decentralised Internet emerged from the session.
Openness and security: the infrastructure must ensure fair data handling and trust
	 
Decentralised business models (distributed, not leveraging massively data extraction): for instance, most Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, propose in another format the walled garden pattern from which blockchain technology was supposed to take us away from.
	 
Pertinence assessment: the appropriateness of decentralised infrastructures has to be proved case by case and where positively evaluated, tailored to the specific needs of entire industry verticals. Blockchain isn’t a one-size-fits-all tool.
	 
Sustainability: environmental, economical and political sustainability has to be designed in such systems from day 1.
	 
Capacity building: more literacy on the topic means more expert people able to maintain the system decentralised and innovate on top of it, as well as better awareness at citizens’ level.

Decentralised Data Governance,31 Oct 2018,"At the NGI Forum 2018 in Porto, a session was led by  Marta Arniani (futuribile / curating futures) on behalf of the NGI Move project on the topic of ""A secure, decentralised Internet"".
The main challenge that echoed out from the session is to avoid the concentration of data (and power) in the hands of a few dominant players. Big corporates have limited interest in empowering their users, but are undoubtedly more competitive than decentralised solutions in the user experience. The challenges to be tackled in this run are building trust in decentralised systems, as well as creating a strong community around the topic while supporting a larger upskilling and literacy. Moreover, citizens will need to better understand what value they can extract from their personal data and become more responsible in managing them.
The session consisted of 4 debates led by experts -
fair and responsible data management (Pablo Ojanguren, Swell RT)
peer to peer approach for a truly decentralised governance (Antonio Tenorio, P2P Models)
a better economic model for our society (Alex D’Elia, Mangrovia Solutions)
a more effective and trackable public funding mechanisms (Sanyu Karani, Funding Box)
The following major challenges were output of each of the debate.
A decentralized infrastructure is not a sufficient condition for a decentralized world. Indeed, many Blockchain applications are build with the objective of becoming new monopolies, the winners that will take all off the markets to come (Antonio Tenorio, P2P Models).
	 
Today the whole process of getting public funds takes in average 24 months. Two years make a brilliant idea obsolete. Blockchain could help shrinking the process to 24 weeks, keeping the procedure transparent, efficient and public. Blockchain-based funding delivery will be tested in the upcoming NGI calls for decentralised technologies and the requirements for it should be decided upon.
	 
Economic models for the new Industrial Revolution: The Token economy in the new Blockchain industry is promoting a new model of “decentralized power” for a better wealth redistribution. Is it enough to use decentralized technologies to foster a better economic model for our society? How can these technologies help us step into the new Industrial Revolution and accelerate the transition?
	 
Users don’t really control how their data are delivered to service providers, which gather it through centralized channels (user interface, web or app) and process them. Moreover, the information returned by the service can be only consumed in one controlled way. It is like buying shoes that you can only wear in the streets allowed by the vendor” (Pablo Ojanguren, Swell RT).
A trending topic at the event was around Blockchain. Blockchain is strongly emerging as an infrastructure appealing to all types of industries. Despite the decentralised nature of blockchain, the business models related to decentralised technologies are still extremely centralised and reinforce the revenue and power of a single player. The real bearers of decentralisation though are governance and business models which should be focussed rather than technology.

General thoughts;
Challenges;
Opportunities;
Examples.
Internet and Data Sovereignty
Described as: Currently a lack of control over personal data. Decentralised data governance. New standards around data portability and interoperability.
General thoughts
Ambiguity around the term “sovereignty”, maybe we should talk about agency.
Not only focus on empowering individuals but also at a collective and community level.
Be aware that with control we also bear responsibility.
Risks and questions about consent and traceability need to be addressed.
Challenges
How to make data understandable and attractive for humans.
Lack of data portability
Lack of plurality due to concentration of data.
As privacy becomes a commodity, there emerges a challenge on inequality.
Data boxes giving control back to users are difficult to execute securely and efficiently.
How do we build trust in leveraging data sharing for social good?
Opportunities
Data commons models empower citizens in controlling their own data.
Requirement for tools providing transparent and accessible interaction.
Data commons models allow for a more pluriform landscape.
Free and Open Source models should be promoted at a European level.

Decentralised Data Governance,07 Feb 2018,"Greetings,
I've had for 5/6 years now the feeling that most of the efforts for open, decentralized, privacy-friendly alternativesive to centralized social networks are as cool as unable to make any real difference, in useful time. I feel that such projects are too complex and/or not ""packaged"" in the right way to make them really usable by ~99.99..% of Facebook users. If they were, Facebook would have not doubled its users in the same 5/6 years.
I started proposing my own vision of a ""first aid"" but concrete solution in 2013: percloud, that is ""PERmanent/PERsonal CLOUD"". Now I have just updated it, and would really like to see it implemented (with or without my own personal involvement is irrelevant, see links below) and in any case get feedback. Therefore, I suggest that Open Internet NGI programmes support development and promotion of perclouds and ""percloud as a service"", as described in these two pages, and the links they contain:

Decentralised Data Governance,19 Jan 2018,"Fixing asymmetry in data governance was a topic mentioned in the Wednesday webinar. Perhaps I misunderstand what this means, but in our current economic system large corporations, such as Google, benefit from hoarding the information they are collecting from us and other companies, and only selectively releasing it back to the rest of us. To me it looks like that fixing this problem would require fixing the economic system itself.
As discussed by e.g. Juliet Schor [1] and Alex Pazaitis et al [2] and indirectly by Jeremy Rifkin [3], our current economic system, including the very structure of money (see e.g. [4]), is not up to date in aligning the public societal interests and private interests. In general, information is an anti-rival good while the tangible things that our life depends on, like food, are rival goods. That is, if I ate a cake, you cannot eat it too, but if I utilise a piece of information, you can do that as well. As Schor, Pazaitis and the others argue, money — as we know it — evolved to serve the exchange of rival goods, leading to what Adam Smith called the ""invisible hand"" aligning the interests of the society in the large with the interests of private actors.  That is the very reason why our capitalistic system works in the first place.
What comes to information, this alignment no longer works. From the societal point of view, the more efficiently we distribute information, the more efficiently the real economy can work. However, we do not have proper structures to motivate companies to share their information.  Of course, the original idea of the patent and copyright systems were to incentivise companies to share their information through giving them exclusive rights for a limited time. However, that has been later watered down and shown not to work as originally intended.
So, returning to the asymmetry in data governance, could it perhaps make sense to create new incentive structures — somewhat similar to what money and rival goods exchange is — that are specifically designed to incentivise efficient sharing of information.  That is, to create structures that make it more beneficial to share all of your information than to keep it as a ""trade secret""?  
That may come about as completely utopian and impossible, but as Pazaitis et al argue [2], there are already attempts to do this within the community and crypto currencies movement.
Now, I am wondering
if such a radical approach to information asymmetries and decentralisation is too far fetched for the ICT-24 call, and if not
if there are any others here who possibly might want to collaborate with us in this area?

Decentralised Data Governance,18 Jan 2018,"Dear all,
I'm a researcher in Semantic Web technology at Ghent University – imec, Belgium.
We're want to address the ICT-24 call with a Web technology stack, emphasizing:
personal data spaces, i.e., a very large number of individual data pods on the Web with relatively few data.
	For example, every single person stores his or her own profile, posts, pictures, health data in a personal data pod with very strict access control.
apps as interchangeable views, i.e., the data exists independently of the Web applications that use it, and data is shared across applications.
	For example, I enter my address book once in my own data pod, and it is used by Contact apps A, B, C, by Meeting Planner apps X and Y, and by a Birthday Reminder app Z.
The important part in this vision are separate markets for data and apps. I describe that vision in detail here: https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/
The technologies we aim to use are:
Core Web technologies (HTTP / HTTPS / URI, …) and output from related W3C working groups (micropayments, …)
Linked Data (RDF / SPARQL / JSON-LD)
blockchain – not as a holy grail / hype, but specifically as trust and incentive mechanism between personal data spaces
Our intention is to use the funding for three aspects:
low-level technology / infrastructure, focusing on data pods and caching/replication
many different decentralized applications on top of that infrastructure
research into economic, legal, privacy aspects
 
We are looking for collaborators to help turn that vision into a strong consortium and proposal.

Decentralised Data Governance,11 Jan 2018,"One of the topics raised in the Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable that needs to be addressed by NGI research topics is that of ""Decentralisation of Control"".  A visualisation of the key factors is provided as shown here:

Decentralisation of Control: Key Factors
The report provides evidence from multiple sources including the 2017 DIN Forum Report which acknowledges that the GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) incumbents are in such a dominant position that it is difficult for European start-ups to compete. The NGI should enable alternative business models and infrastructure to support alternative solutions to the current centralised service offerings.
The Hub4NGI deliverable also cites input on the subject from the Report of the Policy Workshop on Next Generation Internet, Centre for Science and Policy, Cambridge Computer Laboratory from March 2017. Participants in that workshop raised concerns about how the GAFA incumbents were in fact best positioned to exploit emerging AI techniques and ""further entrench their market dominance"". The workshop also discussed how the principles that were the drivers for the TCP/IP protocols, namely lack of ownership and content agnosticism, no longer reflect the current situation in the Internet. The report of the NGI public consultation published in March 2017 echoes this concern noting that 80% of participants agreed that it was important to ""limit the increasing power of dominant platforms aggregating data"" and that 74% saw decentralisation as a means of avoiding monopolies. The consultation report also indicates that participants felt strongly that ""the Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right to choose"". 
To what degree does the current ICT-24-2018 call for proposals address these issues? What could future calls also include in this area?

Decentralised Data Governance,10 Nov 2017,"I recently attended the COST-CONNECT workshop entitled “An interdisciplinary approach on the Next-Generation Internet”, held on 12-13th September, 2017, in Brussels. The event was jointly organised by the COST programme and DG CONNECT of the European Commission with the purpose to bring together the COST and DG CONNECT projects working in relevant areas to NGI topics. 
During the world cafe session part of the event, I led a group discussion pondering a question on how to adequately balance a “citizen centric” Next Generation Internet in an environment where the business models are largely based on the data economy, which uses citizens’ data as a replacement for payment fees or subscription charges.
If we are truly trying to ensure the internet of the future is truly citizen-centric, then we need to address the quandaries such as how do you give people power and control over their data in an internet, which today is largely based on the data economy and making money from this data, are adequately balanced and fully addressed. For example, decentralised data governance in the NGI is key to empowering the citizens in terms of knowing fully what their data is being used for and by whom. That is why it is one of the core selected topics in the upcoming WP2018 for NGI. 
If you are interested in this topic, or want to add to the discussions, please do so. We put together a nice team working on this topic at the COST-CONNECT workshop and we would very much like to hear your views on how to address this important challenge for the NGI.

Decentralised Data Governance,30 Oct 2017,"Distributed architectures for Decentralised data governance
Many of the discussions on decentralised data governance focus on regulatory and policy perspectives, but as Fabrizio Sestini pointed out in his blog on the next generation internet, it's time to look into ways to engineer new network architectures as a way to re-address the balance of power held by a few global aggregators. 
Dominant data platforms have extremely centralised architectures, especially at the level of data governance. The key question is whether technological solutions enabling an intrinsically decentralised data governance break the ""rules of the game"" that have made current data incumbents successful. 
The shift would come from distributed architectures that enable the fully decentralised storage and management of data. In such a scenario, peer-to-peer technologies and distributed ledgers technologies would enable a fully decentralised certification and security of transactions: monetary exchanges and data exchanges.
Current projects exploring the challenges and opportunities include Decode (among others) but the topic is now also part of the EC's Work Programme 2018-2020 (draft) on the next generation internet, specifically ICT-24-2018-2019: NGI - An Open Internet Initiative. R&I Actions closing in 2018
Decentralised data governance:
leveraging on distributed open hardware and software ecosystems based on blockchains, distributed ledger technology, open data and peer-to-peer technologies.
paying attention to ethical, legal and privacy issues, as well as the concepts of autonomy, data sovereignty and ownership, values and regulations.

Responsible AI,28 May 2019,"Hi All, 
I thought it might be interesting to zoom in on what AI means for 5G networks and the challenges that need tackling to realise the benefits, other challenges and on-going work on standardisation. Inspiration for this post comes from Yue Wang, Samsung UK. 
Smart connectivity will combine AI with IoT and 5G, with potentially significant impacts on the production of future intelligent services and products. The convergence of these technologies is expected to transform how industries innovate and operate, including transport systems, smart cities, health monitoring and entertainment. Many AI applications will rely on 5G in the future, from virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to autonomous vehicles and robotics.
However, we are still some way off, as Yue notes in her article, Key Factors Driving the Adoption of AI for 5G and Beyond. 
When #AI in network becomes large scale, we need to consider not only how to use AI to enhance network efficiency but also how to efficiently use #AI. The reusability of data and AI modules, the synergy among them as well as with the network - scalable and deployable #AI.
In summary, the 3 major challenges are:
The data challenge - lack of relevant and mature data sets for AI in the network. This challenge requires the industry to adopt a unified approach with a common language as key to the correct interpretation of data sets from the large-scale 5G infrastructure.
The reliability challenge - lack of confidence in the reliability of the AI solution. This challenge needs a benchmark for assessing the various AI solutions, as well as validation and integration across the network end-to-end.
The deployability challenge - lack of scalability and deployability of existing AI solutions. This challenge needs the validation, integration and network deployment of AI solutions that are scalable and use unified data sets.
The key to the market using AI for 5G and beyond network operation and management is the deployability of the AI solutions IN the network. Because existing solutions are designed for specific parts of the network, problems and applications, they work in isolation and lack scalability. The industry, therefore, needs to work towards a strategy for AI solution development and scalability with unified data sets, validated, integrated and deployed in the network. Such an approach is key to improving both network efficiency and efficiently using AI with re-usable data and AI modules, creating a synergy across them and with the network. This takes us back to the need for uniform data use across the network, the use of common tools and the availability of platforms for validation and integration.
On the research front, we need to focus on AI to develop solutions dealing with safety, privacy, security and trustworthiness. Pressing issues within AI include compliance with privacy regulations, tackling bias in algorithms, mitigating risks and threats with suitable techniques and methods.
We also need to tackle the societal challenges that AI poses, including compliance with privacy regulations, bias in AI algorithms, transparency, right of verification, risks and ethical issues, safety, privacy, security and trustworthiness.
In this respect, future research and innovation (R&I) actions need to look at societal readiness levels, and not just technology and market readiness levels. This is a key point also raised in SpeakNGI.eu discussions with European stakeholders working on robotics while also noting the fascination of small children (aged 5-10) on robots during the International Robotics Festival (September 2018, Pisa). In our view, more work is needed to understand the societal readiness levels across age groups, class systems and countries.
Besides this, AI needs industry collaboration across domains for applications in transport, medicine, finance, robotics, manufacturing and others should become a top priority. Other synergies could come from AI technologies in terms of market segments, and benefits from AI, analytics, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), among others.
On the standards front, we are engaging with ETSI and the chair of the Experimental Networked Intelligence group (ETSI ISG ENI), which is defining a cognitive network management architecture, using AI techniques and context-aware policies to adjust user offered services based on changes in user needs, environmental conditions, and business goals. ENI ISG is developing standards for a cognitive network management system aimed at delivering a metric for the optimisation and adjustment of the operator experience over time by taking advantage of machine learning and reasoning. Using the ‘monitor-analyse-plan-execute’ control model will enable the system to adjust the offered services based on changing conditions. The group is also considering a gap analysis of work on context-aware and policy-based standards with other Standards Developing Organisations to re-use existing standardised solutions for legacy and evolving network functions wherever possible. Its work plan also includes adding closed-loop AI mechanisms based on context-aware, metadata-driven policies to more quickly recognise and incorporate new and changed knowledge, and hence, make actionable decisions, in day-to-day-operations, as well as security and a closed loop learning policy-model.
One of our Early Adopters, Ray Walshe, is helping drive AI standardisation within ISO, the international standards organisation, and IEC, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Here, work is undertaken in JTC/SC42, which has set up a systems integration committee offering guidance on AI applications to IEC, ISO and JTC1 committee. It draws on the support of committees looking into horizontal and vertical areas. As AI matures, JTC/SC42 is adopting a broad approach looking at the full AI ecosystem and beyond traditional interoperability. On top of this, it is running several projects on big data, foundational AI, AI trustworthiness that also encompasses use cases and AI governance applications.

Responsible AI,08 Jan 2019,"Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, has the potential to revolutionise our lives but we need to understand its real-world benefits and plan its usage carefully in Europe.
That’s why the European Commission has published two important reports:

A coordinated plan on artificial intelligence.


New guidelines on how to deal with the ethical issues.

Both reports put humans at the centre of this key technology as it’s essential to use AI to help humans and not develop it for its own sake but make sure it serves the greater good of society. 
Here we take a look at the European coordinated plan and new funding for AI, giving some examples of what is already being developed and testing.
European Funding and Coordinated Plan for Artificial Intelligence
The EU has been supporting Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years but now plans to boost investments through the next funding programme, Digital Europe (2021-2028). It is expected that €2.5 billion will be made available to spur development and uptake across Europe and beyond. The funds come on top of the €1.5 billion being invested between now and 2020 to help drive European leadership on AI. Expected investments from member states and the private sector could bring this figure close to €20 billion in the same period. It’s essential that member states and the Commission work together to maximise investment impacts and drive Europe’s competitiveness.
However, funding is not for funding’s sake but part of a coordinated plan on artificial intelligence, setting out how the EU plans to target investments and coordinate the development of AI across the EU with a strong focus on human needs.
Here are some of the ways innovators can benefit from the new plan starting in 2019

Making €100 million available by 2020 to support European AI start-ups.


Building networks of European AI research centres of excellence to improve cooperation between the best teams in Europe.


Creating a common European Data Space with a focus on healthcare enabling re-use of data by innovators, businesses and the public sector.


Developing an AI-on-demand platform pooling knowledge and expertise to expand access to existing body of work on AI in the EU.


Attracting and retaining skilled AI professionals in the EU.

Snapshot of AI developments and Testing in Europe
With the plan in mind, it’s important that innovators across the public and private sectors have a good idea of what is already being developed and tested on AI, thus avoiding unnecessary overlap. Here’s a snapshot to get you started.
(Semi-)Autonomous driving 
Road accidents have huge societal and economic impacts, and are a major concern for public safety. As human error is the main cause of accidents, intelligent driver systems monitoring the driver’s state and behaviour could lead to improved collective safety.
VI-DAS (vision-inspired driver assistance systems) is an EU project taking forward the design of next-gen 720° connected scene analysis and driver status (ADAS).  Advances in sensors, data fusion, machine learning and user feedback give the capability of understanding driver, vehicle and scene context as significant steps towards truly semi-autonomous vehicles. Cars driven by using AI turn the human eyes, ears, feet and hands into sensors and the data collected sends back all the signals a driver would normally process, e.g. how close the car is to other vehicles, what speed is it travelling, the behaviour of other road users such as cyclists or pedestrians, etc.  VI-DAS is developing a system that will allow cars to switch seamlessly between their human and automated drivers, based on data from real drivers in a variety of conditions and cases.
Healthcare
The European project MURAB stands for MRI and ultrasound robotic assisted biopsy. Current techniques used to diagnose breast cancer can lead to 10-20% of patients being wrongly informed. What’s more , tissue sampling methods are lengthy and often inaccurate. MURAB sets out to change this by  developing a more accurate technique that overlays MRI scans taken by AI-driven robots with images from ultrasound and pressure sensors to a give a much clearer view of potentially diseased areas and making it easier to target the area for tissue samples.
Smart cities
AI will have many potential applications in smart cities, from helping identify people in crowds using face-recognition software - preventing terrorist attacks or finding a lost child in a crowd - to monitoring air quality conditions and taking appropriate actions like limiting traffic flows or sending out automatic alerts to citizens. Diverse applications are already being tested in European projects that are part of the IoT Large-scale pilots programme, such as ACTIVAGE, Autopilot, IoF, CREATE-IoT, MONICA, Synchronicity and U4IoT.  The projects bring together innovators to facilitate the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe by integrating advanced IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstrating multiple IoT applications at scale and in a usage context as close as possible to operational conditions.
ACTIVAGE (activating innovative IoT smart living environment for ageing well): deploying and operating at large scale Active & Healthy Ageing IoT based solutions and services, supporting and extending the independent living of older adults in their living environments, and responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities.
AutoPilot (automated driving progressed by Internet of Things): increasing safety, providing more comfort and creating many new business opportunities for mobility services.
IoF (Internet of food and farm 2020): accelerating the adoption of IoT for securing sufficient, safe and healthy food and strengthening the competitiveness of farming and food chains in Europe.
MONICA (management of networked IoT Wearables - very large-scale demonstration of cultural societal): providing a very large-scale demonstration of multiple existing and new Internet of Things technologies for Smarter Living.
CREATE-IoT (cross fertilisation through alignment synchronisation and exchanges for IoT): stimulating collaboration between IoT initiatives, fostering the uptake of IoT in Europe and supporting the development and growth of IoT ecosystems based on open technologies and platforms. 
Synchronicity (delivering an IoT enabled Digital Single Market for Europe and Beyond: working to establish a reference architecture for the envisioned IoT-enabled city market place with identified interoperability points, interfaces and data models for different verticals. Synchronicity is a member of the early adopters Club for the next generation internet. 
U4IoT (user engagement for large scale pilots in the Internet of Things): developing a toolkit for large-scale pilot end-user engagement and adoption, including online resources, privacy-compliant crowdsourcing tools, guidelines and an innovative privacy game for personal data protection risk assessment and awareness, online training modules.

Responsible AI,26 Mar 2018,"Current efforts to find answers to the ethical, societal and legal challenges posed by AI and autonomous technologies and to orient them for the common good represent a patchwork of disparate initiatives. This underlines the need for a collective, wide-ranging and inclusive process of reflection and dialogue. A statement by the European Group on Ethics calls for the launch of such a process that would pave the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for the design, production, use and governance of artificial intelligence, robotics, and ‘autonomous’ systems.
Following is a brief overview of various disparate standalone initiatives on this subject followed by the statement from EGE calling for a collective initiative-
Some of the most prominent initiatives towards the formulation of ethical principles regarding AI and ‘autonomous’ systems have stemmed from industry, practitioners and professional associations, such as the IEEE's policy paper on Ethically Aligned Design, ITU's Global Summit AI for Good, and the ACM's Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society. Within the private sector, companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Google's DeepMind have established their own ethic codes on AI and joined forces in creating broad initiatives such as the Partnership on AI or OpenAI, which bring together industry, non-profit and academic organisations.
	 
One of the leading initiatives calling for a responsible development of AI has been launched by the Future of Life Institute and has culminated in the creation of the ‘Asilomar AI Principles’. This list of 23 fundamental principles to guide AI research and application has been signed by hundreds of stakeholders, with signatories representing predominantly scientists, AI researchers and industry. A similar participatory process has been launched though the Forum on the Socially Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence held by the University of Montreal, in reaction to which a first draft of a potential ‘Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence’ has been developed. It is publicly accessible on an online platform where all sectors of society are invited to comment on the text.
	 
A worldwide debate on the military use of AI has been initiated by the UN and the meetings for the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW, Geneva), where a majority of the High Contracting Parties endorsed the so-called principle of ‘meaningful human control for LAWS’ stating that ‘Autonomous Weapons Systems that require no meaningful human control should be prohibited’ (General Assembly UN, 2016). The UN has also established a special research institute in The Hague to study the governance of Robotics and AI (UNICRI).
	 
At the national level initiatives are uneven, with some countries prioritising the development of rules for robots and artificial intelligence and going so far as to adopt legislation (e.g. to regulate self-driving cars on public roads), whereas other countries are yet to deal with the matter. This lack of a harmonised European approach has prompted the European Parliament to call for a range of measures to prepare for the regulation of advanced robotics including the development of a guiding ethical framework for the design, production and use of robots.
Against this backdrop, the EGE draws attention to the risks inherent to uncoordinated, unbalanced approaches in the regulation of AI and ‘autonomous’ technologies. Regulatory patchworks may give rise to ‘ethics shopping’, resulting in the relocation of AI development and exploitation by regions with lower ethical standards. Allowing the debate to be dominated by certain regions, disciplines, demographics or industry actors risks excluding a wider set of societal interests and perspectives. Current discussions sometimes also lack an overview of ‘autonomous’ technologies that are likely to be studied, developed and implemented in the next decade, leaving a blind spot when it comes to regulatory foresight.
The EGE calls for a wide-ranging and systematic public engagement and deliberation on the ethics of AI, robotics and ‘autonomous’ technology and on the set of values that societies choose to embed in the development and governance of these technologies, proposing a set of ethical principles to start with. It should integrate a wide, inclusive and far-reaching societal debate, drawing upon the input of diverse perspectives, where those with different expertise and values can be heard.
The EGE calls upon the European Commission to investigate which existing legal instruments are available to effectively deal with the problems discussed in this statement and whether new governance and regulatory instruments are required.
The EGE calls for the launch of a process that paves the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for the design, production, use and governance of artificial intelligence, robotics, and ‘autonomous’ systems. This process, in which the EGE stands ready to play its part, should provide a platform for joining together the diverse global initiatives outlined above.
The EGE in its statement urges the European Union to place itself at the vanguard of such a process and calls upon the European Commission to launch and support its implementation.
",Towards a shared Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence,https://consultation.ngi.eu/channels/responsible-ai/towards-shared-ethical-framework-artificial-intelligence,https://consultation.ngi.eu/users/ngi-report-analyser,ngi-report-analyser
Responsible AI,26 Mar 2018,"Artificial intelligence, robotics and ‘autonomous’ systems can bring prosperity, contribute to well-being and help to achieve European moral ideals and socio-economic goals if designed and deployed wisely. Thus to safeguard and steer their development in the right direction, a range of increasingly urgent and complex moral questions have emerged as summarized here.  European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) on their part released a statement calling for the launch of a process that would pave the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework in answering those moral questions and to guide future design, production, use and governance of artificial intelligence, robotics, and ‘autonomous’ systems.
As a first step, statement proposes a set of fundamental ethical principles and democratic prerequisites, based on the values laid down in the EU Treaties and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which may serve as a basis for the establishment of global standards, legislative action, and ethical guidelines for AI and autonomous systems. The proposed principles are summarized as below-
Human dignity: The principle of human dignity, understood as the recognition of the inherent human state of being worthy of respect, must not be violated by ‘autonomous’ technologies. This means, for instance, that there are limits to determinations and classifications concerning persons, made on the basis of algorithms and ‘autonomous’ systems, especially when those affected by them are not informed about them. It also requires that we as humans be aware of whether and when we are interacting with a machine or another human being, and that we reserve the right to vest certain tasks to the human or the machine.
	 
Autonomy: The principle of autonomy implies the freedom of the human being. All ‘autonomous’ technologies must, hence, honour the human ability to choose whether, when and how to delegate decisions and actions to them.
	 
Responsibility: The principle of responsibility must be fundamental to AI research and application. ‘Autonomous’ systems should only be developed and used in ways that serve the global social and environmental good, as determined by outcomes of deliberative democratic processes. As the potential misuse of ‘autonomous’ technologies poses a major challenge, risk awareness and a precautionary approach are crucial.
	 
Justice, equity, and solidarity: AI should contribute to global justice and equal access to the benefits and advantages that its related technologies bring. Discriminatory biases in data sets used to train and run AI systems should be prevented or detected, reported and neutralised at the earliest stage possible.
	 
Democracy: Key decisions on the regulation of AI development and application should be the result of democratic debate and public engagement. A spirit of global cooperation and public dialogue on the issue will ensure that they are taken in an inclusive, informed, and farsighted manner. The right to receive education or access information on new technologies and their ethical implications will facilitate that everyone understands risks and opportunities and is empowered to participate in decisional processes that crucially shape our future.
	 
Rule of law and accountability: The whole range of legal challenges arising in the field of AI and autonomous systems should be addressed with timely investment in the development of robust solutions that provide a fair and clear allocation of responsibilities and efficient mechanisms of binding law. In this regard, governments and international organisations ought to increase their efforts in clarifying with whom liabilities lie for damages caused by undesired behaviour of ‘autonomous’ systems. Moreover, effective harm mitigation systems should be in place.
	 
Security, safety, bodily and mental integrity: Safety and security of ‘autonomous’ systems materialises in three forms: (1) external safety for their environment and users, (2) reliability and internal robustness, e.g. against hacking, and (3) emotional safety with respect to human-machine interaction. All dimensions of safety must be taken into account by AI developers and strictly tested before release. Special attention should also be paid to potential dual use and weaponisation of AI, e.g. in cybersecurity, finance, infrastructure and armed conflict.
	 
Data protection and privacy: In an age of ubiquitous and massive collection of data through digital communication technologies, the right to protection of personal information and the right to respect for privacy are crucially challenged. Both physical AI robots as part of the Internet of Things, as well as AI softbots that operate via the World Wide Web must comply with data protection regulations and not collect and spread data or be run on sets of data for whose use and dissemination no informed consent has been given.
	 
Sustainability: AI technology must be in line with the human responsibility to ensure the basic preconditions for life on our planet, continued prospering for mankind and preservation of a good environment for future generations. Strategies to prevent future technologies from detrimentally affecting human life and nature are to be based on policies that ensure the priority of environmental protection and sustainability.
The above ethical considerations can be used to shape the world of future AI technologies and should be construed as stimulus and opportunities for innovation, and not impediments and barriers.

Responsible AI,26 Mar 2018,"Advances in AI, robotics and so-called autonomous technologies warrants special reflection as they can be oriented divergent from common good and pose ethical, societal and legal challenges. European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) released a statement calling for the launch of a process that would pave the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for the design, production, use and governance of artificial intelligence, robotics, and ‘autonomous’ systems.
The EGE statement also investigates that the current ethical frameworks governing autonomous systems are very narrow which implies an often overly simplistic metrics in human affairs, suggesting a need for wider ethical framework, citing example from 3 applications.
In 2016, moral controversy stirred up when the first person was killed in a car crash while driving in ‘autonomous’ mode. Moral debates are now often limited to discussion of exceptional use cases concerning so-called ‘Trolley Problem’ thought experiments. These cases are concerned with dilemmas of unavoidable accidents in which the only available choice is between options associated with the loss of human lives. Central questions in that framing mainly seem to concern how ‘autonomous’ systems should be programmed so that their deployment leads to morally acceptable outcomes in terms of lives lost respectively lives saved. This neglects broader questions such as ‘which design decisions were taken in the past that have led up to this moral predicament’, ‘which values should inform design’, ‘how should values in design be weighed in case of conflict, and by whom’.
	 
A large debate on autonomous weapon system takes place at the Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva concerning the moral acceptability of ‘autonomous’ weapons and legal and moral responsibility for the deployment of these systems. However, attention also needs to be widened to questions such as - the nature and meaning of ‘meaningful human control’ over these systems and how to institute morally desirable forms of control.
	 
Without human intervention and control from outside, smart systems today conduct dialogues with customers in online call-centres; speech recognition interfaces and recommender systems of online platforms, e.g. Siri, Alexa and Cortana, make suggestions to users. Beyond the straightforward questions of data protection and privacy, a wider ethical framework is necessary that may ask whether people have a right to know whether they are dealing with a human being or with an AI artefact. Moreover, the question arises whether there should be limits to what AI systems can suggest to a person, based on a construction of the person's own conception of their identity.
While there is growing awareness of the need to address such questions, AI and robotics are currently advancing more rapidly than the process of finding answers to these thorny ethical, legal and societal questions. Current efforts represent a patchwork of disparate initiatives. There is a clear need for a collective, wide-ranging and inclusive process that would pave the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical framework for the design, production, use and governance of AI, robots and ‘autonomous’ systems as recognized in the statement by EGE.
",Beyond a narrow ethical framework governing autonomous systems,https://consultation.ngi.eu/channels/responsible-ai/beyond-narrow-ethical-framework-governing-autonomous-systems,https://consultation.ngi.eu/users/ngi-report-analyser,ngi-report-analyser
Responsible AI,26 Mar 2018,"Advances in AI, robotics and so-called autonomous technologies warrants special reflection as they can be oriented divergent from common good and pose ethical, societal and legal challenges.  European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) thus released a statement calling for the launch of a process that would pave the way towards a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for the design, production, use and governance of artificial intelligence, robotics, and ‘autonomous’ systems.
Self-driving cars and drones, robots in deep sea and space exploration, weapon systems, software agents, such as bots in financial trade, and deep learning in medical diagnosis, are among the most prominent examples of Autonomous Systems. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the form of machine learning, and the increasing availability of large datasets from various domains of life are important drivers of these systems. The confluence of these digital technologies is rapidly making them more powerful, they are applied in an increasing number of new products, and can have both military and civilian application. The advent of these high-tech systems and software that can function increasingly independently of humans and can execute tasks that would require intelligence when carried out by humans, warrants special reflection. These systems give rise to a range of important and hard moral questions as recognized by the EGE statement-
Questions about safety, security, the prevention of harm and the mitigation of risks. How can we make a world with interconnected AI and ‘autonomous’ devices safe and secure and how can we gauge the risks?
	 
Questions about Human moral responsibility. Where is the morally relevant agency located in dynamic and complex socio-technical systems with advanced AI and robotic components? How should moral responsibility be attributed and apportioned and who is responsible for untoward outcomes? Does it make sense to speak about ‘shared control’ and ‘shared responsibility’ between humans and smart machines?
	 
Questions about governance, regulation, design, development, inspection, monitoring, testing and certification. How should our institutions and laws be redesigned to ensure AI and autonomous systems serve the welfare of individuals and society, and to make society safe for this technology.
	 
Questions regarding democratic decision making. Investigations are carried out across the globe to establish the extent to which citizens are taken advantage of by the use of advanced nudging techniques based on the combination of machine learning, big data and behavioural science, which make possible the subtle profiling, micro-targeting, tailoring and manipulation of choice architectures in accordance with commercial or political purposes.
	 
Questions about the explainability and transparency of AI and autonomous systems. Which values do these systems effectively and demonstrably serve? And which values are we letting to be undermined – openly or silently – in the technological progress and utility trade-offs? AI driven ‘optimisation’ of social processes based on social scoring systems with which some countries experiment, violate the basic idea of equality and freedom in the same way caste systems do, because they construct ‘different kinds of people’ where there are in reality only ‘different properties’ of people. How can the attack on democratic systems and the utilisation of scoring systems, as a basis for dominance by those who have access to these powerful technologies, be prevented?
The statement also describes following considerations from an ethical perspective in searching for the answers to above questions.
Autonomy in the ethically relevant sense of the word can only be attributed to human beings. The terminology of ‘autonomous’ systems has however widely gained currency in the scientific literature and public debate to refer to the highest degree of automation and the highest degree of independence from human beings in terms of operational and decisional ‘autonomy’. Human beings ought to be able to determine which values are served by technology, what is morally relevant and which final goals and conceptions of the good are worthy to be pursued. This cannot be left to machines, no matter how powerful they are.
	 
Moral responsibility, in whatever sense, cannot be allocated or shifted to ‘autonomous’ technology. In recent debates about Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) and Autonomous Vehicles there seems to exist a broad consensus that Meaningful Human Control is essential for moral responsibility. The principle of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) was first suggested for constraining the development and utilisation of future weapon systems. This means that humans - and not computers and their algorithms - should ultimately remain in control, and thus be morally responsible.
While there is growing awareness of the need to address such questions, AI and robotics are currently advancing more rapidly than the process of finding answers to these thorny ethical, legal and societal questions. Current efforts represent a patchwork of disparate initiatives. EGE, as expressed in its statement, is of the opinion that Europe should play an active and prominent role in defining a collective and inclusive process to propose a set of fundamental ethical principles and democratic prerequisites that could also guide light on binding laws to check any violation by autonomous systems and AI.

Responsible AI,13 Mar 2018,"There’s a lot of fear surrounding artificial intelligence these days, and it’s hard to know what's warranted and what isn’t.
Some people believe that AI is far more dangerous than nukes and the humanity would be in danger because of the next world war in which the consequent destruction would not be down to nuclear weapons, but AI.
However, a recent article published in Entrepreneur magazine argues against this myth. It stated that for all AI to overthrow humanity, four things would have to occur:
1.    An AI would have to develop a sense of self distinct from others and have the intellectual capacity to step outside the intended purpose of its programmed boundaries
2.    It would have to develop, out of the billions of possible feelings, a desire for something that it believes is incompatible with human existence
3.    It would have to choose a plan for dealing with its feelings (out of the billions of possible plans) that involved death, destruction and mayhem
4.    It would have to have the computing power / intelligence / resources to enact such a plan
An AI achieving any of these is highly unlikely. To achieve all of it? Next to impossible. It is improbable for an AI system to achieve consciousness -- the ability to think about oneself as an object and self-direct action. Machine learning is achieved by training a machine using millions of bits of diagnostic information in order to teach the machine how to do and what to do in a certain situation. The machine can only do what it is programmed for.
What we’re seeing again and again are forward-thinkers applying AI to situations where what we need is speed: identifying specifics based on complex statistical models, understanding and processing enormous amounts of data to solve otherwise-impossible problems. AI isn’t the “demon” it’s made out to be; inherently it’s useful and will allow us to affect change like we never have before.
Instead of fearing from the AI, the most pressing need is to brainstorm about the legislative and ethical aspects of AI. What if the training data is incorrect or not comprehensive? What if the training algorithm is bugy. What if the artificially intelligent machine make harm to anybody? Who will be prosecuted? Machine? the owner? the programmer? the manufacturer?

Responsible AI,15 Feb 2018,"Technologists themselves say the technology needs to align with human values, and that ethical dimensions must be prioritised at every stage of the design, development and deployment of AI systems.
The ISOC report on “Paths to Our Digital Future” released in 2017 brought attention to the fact that there could be extensive ethical concerns due to AI and automation. The speed at which AI and related technologies are being developed and deployed will require significant investment and effort in the short term to avoid unintended consequences for society and humanity. “We will need focused research and effective governance structures to make sure AI technologies create opportunities and not harm”.
The report also address the concern that AI also raises serious considerations related to privacy, transparency, safety, the nature of work and jobs, and the overall economy. For example, technologies such as facial recognition based on AI can improve user experience over a social media platform. But the same technologies can be used to improve surveillance and compromise anonymity. Or, if AI becomes a permanent feature in social media networks and online platforms, where algorithms are used to curate the online experience, questions about free choice and bias will intensify. Concerns about the transparency and accountability of data collection and decision-making will accelerate calls for ethical principles to guide AI design and deployment.
Governments need to have available skills and resources in order to address the larger economic and social impacts of AI. Within governments, AI could bring about a fundamental reshaping of decision-making as policy development is increasingly data driven. By extension, there is a risk that AI could become an unaccountable and non-transparent decision-making tool for future policy choices.
Many foresee a fierce, competitive battle to dominate the commercial AI space in coming years. While this will likely drive innovation and possibly disrupt current market structures, there are also concerns about competition. Forecasters believe that today’s leading technology firms will control the market for AI platforms for the foreseeable future.

Responsible AI,15 Jan 2018,"It is important to have an ethical framework in place for artificially intelligent and autonomous machines. In the Net Future 2017 debate on Legal, ethical and social issues in a software defined world, there was a disagreement among the participants regarding the ethical considerations of AI. It was advocated by some participants that the ethical framework and legal standards should be designed and built into the system design.  However this raises a question that what happens to the learning algorithm and how it can be designed with such ethics in mind?
The counter argument is that the application of technology should be the subject of legality and ethics rather than the technology itself. It is argued that the use of technology is to be accountable against legal and ethical questions rather than the technology. Trying to put ethics into technology design might constrain it.
It is however still a question to be answered that how ethics can be designed into AI technology and where these ethical and legal questions lie.
The question of ethics for autonomous machines is not new and lessons can be learned from the societal impacts of robotics, a well-cited example from 1942 being Isaac Asmiov’s ""Three Laws of Robotics"".
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
The concept of robotics as tools is discussed in  EPSRC and AHRC Robotics Retreat held in September 2010, supporting the notion that it is the application that the tool is put to that needs ethical consideration and legislation governing what is permissible.
The Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable recommends that multi-disciplinary research and discussion are undertaken to provide answers to legal and ethical questions surrounding AI and its applications: 
How should legislation be brought to effect on AI systems?
What are the most appropriate regulations?

Are AI systems ever likely to be legal entities?
How can an AI system be incentivised to be compliant with the law? It does not understand the notions of penalties for non-compliance.

Should ethics be designed into AI technology, or should ethics apply to the applications
	of AI technology?
How can commitments be acquired from creators of AI technology to issue patches for
	safety critical flaws over the long term?

Responsible AI,15 Jan 2018,"In the Hub4NGI D2.1, a significant issue regarding the responsible AI has been raised which is about whether and how can an AI algorithm be accountable for its actions.
The issue of Algorithmic Accountability was also raised in Net Futures debate ""Legal, ethical and social issues in a software defined world"" and the participants agreed that there is a responsibility gap for the AI systems.
Transparency is considered to be a key aspect of algorithmic accountability as depicted in the Net Future 2017 debate session. And it is widely agreed that the algorithms need to be able to explain their decisions.
Furthermore, the biasness and discrimination might also be a big issue and it is possible that the algorithm may discriminate people because of their gender, race, ethnic or religious associations. For example, there might be the case when an algorithm filters Curriculum Vitae in recruitment situations. So the transparency should enable every concerned citizen understand how their personnel data is being used. Because of the inputs and training data, biasness can be built into AI algorithm. Therefore the training and input process should be transparent in such a way that citizens can trust on the AI system.
The Algorithmic Accountability is to trying to find the answers for the following questions:
How to trust a black box algorithm?
How to opt out of algorithm use?
To what extent do algorithms violate privacy?
If an algorithm causes harm, who or what is responsible?
Transparency: how can AI systems explain their decisions?
How can bias be eliminated from AI systems?
Research and discussion involving multidisciplinary teams from the legal, sociological and technical domains is needed to provide the answers for ethical and legal questions.

Responsible AI,04 Jan 2018,"If something has been dividing people on the tech front for some time now it is artificial intelligence (AI). Not even some of the brightest minds, many of them regular speakers at TED conferences, can agree on whether AI will empower us as human beings or kill us, softly but surely.
Well-known, forward-thinking luminaries like Elon Musk have been among those calling for caution, warning that AI could ultimately overpower us and even cause an AI apocalypse.
So, is AI all doom and gloom or an opportunity to hold on ever more tightly to human values and ethics?
These opinion pieces don’t give a definitive answer as to whether AI is ultimately good or bad but they will give you a good idea of the major factors at play and help you form your own opinion. Feel free to post comments below!
Major risks at stake
At the 2016 TED Summit, Neuroscientist and Philosopher Sam Harris warned, “If intelligence is just a matter of information processing, and we continue to improve our machines, we will produce some form of super intelligence. And we have no idea how long it will take us to do that safely.”
Harris added, “The moment we admit that some appropriate computational system is the basis of what intelligence is, and we admit that we will improve this system continuously, and we admit that the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know, then we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god. Now would be a good time to make sure it’s a god we could live with.”
He stressed the importance of keeping super intelligent AI in check. The problem is, if AI goes wrong, even in the first try, apocalyptic consequences may be likely.
“When you’re talking about super-intelligent AI that can make changes to itself, we only have one chance to get the initial conditions right. And even then, we will need to absorb the economic and political consequences of getting them right,” he added.
Check out the TED Talk here: Can we build AI without losing control over it? - Sam Harris
For technologist and TEDx Brussels 2014 speaker Jeremy Howard, the AI revolution that the super intelligent AI will bring will have a stronger impact than what the Industrial Revolution did to the 19th century society.
Howard explained that when engines started taking over jobs in the 19th century, there was drastic social disruption which eventually settled down after a while. On the other hand, he continued, “The machine learning revolution will be different from industrial revolution because it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities, the more they can build better computers with intellectual capabilities, so this will be a change that the world has never seen before.”
He says the difference lies in the fact that, through deep learning, AI capability grows exponentially, as opposed to the growth of engine capability before.
“It’s already impacting us”, Howard warned. “In the last 25 years, as capital productivity increased, labour productivity has been flat and even a bit down. So, I want us to start having the discussion now. So, we have to start thinking how are we going to adjust our economic and social structures to be aware of this new reality.”
The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn – Jeremy Howard
Is AI Worth It?
There’s a reason why despite the many risks associated with AI, scientists are still pursuing its development. Many would argue that AI’s more tangible benefits that are closer to realization than the prophesied doomsday scenario and have far more weight.
One of the biggest developments was proposed by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil during the TED 2014 conference in Vancouver.
He said that nanobots will allow the brain to connect to our human neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud, thus providing an extension of our brain. “Now today, you have a computer in your phone but if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds to do a complex search, you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. Our thinking then would be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking.”
Check out the TED Talk here: Get ready for hybrid thinking – Ray Kurzweil
“Non-biological thinking will be subject to the accelerating law of returns – it will grow exponentially. And remember what happened the last time we expanded our neocortex? That was 2 million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads. The frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different – it’s a quantitative expansion of the neocortex. But that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and advance language, art, science and technology.”
Kurzweil explained that no other species has done that. “So, in the next few decades, we’re going to do it again, we’re going to expand our neocortex, only this time, we won’t be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure, it will be expanded without limit. That again will be the enabling factor for a qualitative leap in culture and technology.”
Siri creator and TED2017 speaker Tom Gruber echoed the sentiments of Kurzweil when he said, “I think the purpose of AI is to empower humans with machine intelligence. And as machines get smarter, we get smarter. I call this, humanistic AI - artificial intelligence designed to meet human needs by collaborating and helping people.”
“We can choose to make AI automate and compete with us, or we can use AI to augment and collaborate with us - to overcome our cognitive limitations and to help us do what we want to do, only better. And that is why every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter.”
Fei-Fei Li, who is developing a technology that will allow computers to see and understand images, also agrees with the benefits brought by AI. “When machines can see, doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them diagnose and take care of patients. Cars will run smarter and safer on the road. Robots, not just human will help us brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded. We would discover new species, better materials and explore unseen frontiers with the help of machines.”
She added, “First, we teach them to see. Then, they help us to see better. We will not only use the machines for their intelligence. We will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine.”
Solving the AI fears may lie in ethics
The argument is that almost any benefit brought by AI can be turned against humans. This is why many experts believe ethics should be at the centre of discussions on AI. How we think about ethics in the AI context is the key to answering today’s biggest AI fears.
Techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, during the 2016 TED Summit, cites an example of a predictive AI technology now being used to determine hiring in companies and rate the likelihood of criminal offenders re-offending. However, despite it being meant to be impartial, their algorithms still seem to have been imbued with biases that people have.
She said, “Artificial intelligence doesn’t give us a get out of ethics free card. We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion, scrutiny and investigation. We need to make sure we have algorithmic accountability and auditing and meaningful transparency. Bringing math and computation to messy, value-laden human affairs, doesn’t bring objectivity, rather the complexity of human affairs invades the algorithms.”
Tufekci agreed that we should use computation to help us make better decisions. “We have to own up to our moral responsibility and use algorithms within that framework, and not as a means to abdicate and outsource our responsibilities. Machine intelligence is here. That means we should hold on ever tighter to human values and ethics.”
Check out the TED Talk here: Machine intelligence makes human morals more important – Zeynep Tufekci
Another way to solve the fundamental issues of AI was proposed by Nick Bostrom, speaker during the TED2015 conference. He said that the key is to figure out how to create super intelligent AI such that even if, or when it does an unplanned action, it’s still safe because it is fundamentally on our side and because it shares our values.
“We would create an AI that uses its intelligence to learn what we value. And its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or perform actions that it predicts what we would have approved of,” Bostrom said.
He adds, “The values that the AI has need to match ours not just in the familiar context, like where we can easily check how the AI behaves but also all novel contexts that the AI may encounter in the near future.”
Conclusion
As you’ve seen, AI experts are divided between those that see AI as an extension of us and thus, an improvement for humans and those that believe AI will destroy us (or at least be harmful to our society in the long-run). However, there are those that think ethics plays a key role in preventing the latter from happening.
Whether you’re for, against or undecided about AI, one thing is for sure – that we as a society will have to think seriously about how we want AI to develop as it embeds itself more and more into our lives.

AI is already being used to address the challenges of an ageing population and detecting breast cancer in the US. Mammograms play a crucial role in detecting breast cancer but they also throw up false positives, such as lesions that appear suspicious. Once operated on, many such lesions turn out to be benign. With so much uncertainty in data, machine learning is the tool we need to improve detection and prevent over-treatment. In the US alone, 40,000 women dies from breast cancer every year, but when cancers are found early enough, they can often be cured.

Blockchain as an Enabler for NGI,28 May 2019,"Hi All,
we've been investigating blockchain from several perspectives, such as identity and privacy, as well as civil society. Here, we look at the future trajectory of blockchain with insights from research and standards. Then we zoom in on work by civil society stakeholders.
Inspiration on the research side comes from Cathy Mulligan, Imperial College London, on the promise, and potential pittfalls of blockchain. 
Blockchain is among the latest waves of digitisation enabled by the worldwide distribution of computing capacity. There are essentially two types of blockchains: permissioned (private) and permissionless (public, e.g. bitcoin). Permissioned distributed ledgers are a better match for business-oriented use cases that are of interest to industry and governmental institutions.
A key public aspect of Blockchain is its value as a timestamped and chronologically recorded digital ledger type transaction that allows anyone to download the code and start mining bitcoin or take part in new network ideas built on the Ethereum platform.
Blockchain promises to redefine trust, transparency and inclusion across the world. Transparency comes from the participation of huge parts of the public while trust is built from the almost impossibility to record malicious entries or change transactions already processed.
It is arguable how well blockchain captures that notion of trust, or whether any technology can ever actually replicate what a human being thinks, feels and acts like when they trust and are trusted. These concepts are deeply human, as are the power structures within which digital solutions are built.
It may or may not overcome its technical and environmental challenges, but the concept of citizen-led and citizen-owned solutions to global problems has been unleashed.
Blockchain speaks to a deep human need to be able to trust other people, organisations and companies in an increasingly digital world though more work is needed on exactly how we prove this trust-building process.
Blockchain can help us organise society differently by enabling new levels of cooperation and new types of partnerships across geographical and sectoral borders. This shows us how important it is to support transparency and inclusion and what they should look like in the digital world.
Blockchain’s focus on inclusion, trust and multilateralism is expected to continue for many decades but needs the support of governments, civil society, academia and industry.
Blockchain is cross-border. As such it requires a unified, multilateral approach to regulation. Civil services need to understand how their regulations may be interpreted in code, from multi-stakeholder perspectives and thinking about laws in one country may impact people in another country.
It is likely that the key legacy of blockchain will be that when computing power is handed to a large part of the population—rather than solely housed in corporations—completely new solutions to old problems will emerge. In the case of blockchain, it began with a desire to see a new form of banking system, one that was truly native to the digital world we are all starting to inhabit.
Blockchain is a relatively immature technology, which does not exist in a vacuum. On the negative side, it may potentially create as many problems as it solves. Yet it can yield insights into emerging technologies and how we can face them head on in a rapidly changing world.
Blockchain is still new and will evolve many times before it can be fully integrated into society. We should not see it as a fully functional solution but as a lens on the possible. Its possibilities merit the attention of everyone. For example, users on the consultation platform have raised the issue of the Blockchain-GDPR Paradox, whereas storing personal data on a blockchain is not an option according to GDPR, since the data “should be erasable” at any point in time, which wouldn’t be possible if it was in a blockchain transaction.
Civil Society Lens: Leadership on priority issues – Champions perspectives
The NGI Champions Panel includes experts from civil society, notably the International civil society centre. Here's what they're doing on blockchain. 
It is key to act now on collaborative blockchain and big data projects in organisations like the International Civil Society Centre to make our voices heard right across the globe.
These projects are vital for leading the way and zooming in on priority topics like data privacy and security.
New projects include:
Data-driven advocacy partnerships for sustainable development goals (SDGs), developing a data collaboration method focused on the evidence-based advocacy for the leave no one behind agenda. The idea is to use the Centre’s Leave No One Behind project as a case study on how to use big data effectively at different project stages.
Big data for impact measurement, using various big data sets to discover new insights, creating an impact measurement tool to improve decision-making.
Plan Omega, exploring how to establish a CSO Blockchain to improve efforts to protect and expand the civic space, mapping relevant CSO actors and technology experts to gauge the viability of building the CSO blockchain.
Cryptocurrency and CSO transaction costs, exploring the possibilities of using an existing or setting up a new cryptocurrency for the CSO sector exclusively and verifying whether it can reduce transaction costs.

Blockchain as an Enabler for NGI,18 Dec 2018,"A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, linked together with cryptography. By design, the data from a blockchain cannot be modified. It is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties in an efficient and secure manner. 
Mostly known for cryptocurrencies, blockchains can be used  for digital identity attributes, object tracking, or the verification of service level agreements. 
Distributed ledgers like blockchain can be either permissionless (public) or permissioned (private). 
Permissioned distributed ledgers are better qualified to address the more business-oriented use cases that are of interest to industry and governmental institutions (as opposed to permissionless ledgers like Bitcoin). 
The creation of a new ETSI Industry Specification Group on blockchain: Permissioned Distributed Ledgers in December 2018 marks an important step towards standards setting. The ISG PDL group will analyse and provide the foundations to operate permissioned distributed ledgers to be deployed across industry and governmental institutions. 
While leading EU industry is making an important contribution, it is also important to note that standards are most valuable when they are globally applicable. Hence, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Telefonica, Vodafone and others will be working together on the challenges related to the operation of permissioned distributed ledgers, business use cases, functional architecture and solutions for operating the ledgers, including interfaces/APIs/protocols and information/data models.

Blockchain as an Enabler for NGI,24 Nov 2017,"You most likely already have seen CE marks. Some toys and other manufactured products have a ""CE"" written somewhere. The CE marking is a key indicator (but not proof) of a product’s compliance with European Union (EU) health, safety and environmental protection directives and regulations. CE marking is necessary to get access to the European market and there are many service providers out there that want to sell their consulting, testing and certification services to help get the CE mark.
It applies to the following products (non-exhaustive list): active implantable medical devices, appliances burning gaseous fuels (gas appliances), cableway installations designed to carry persons, energy related products, electronics and active components, equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX equipment), explosives for civil uses, hot-water boilers, household refrigerators and freezers, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, lifts, low voltage equipment (electrical material), machinery, measuring instruments, medical devices, outdoor equipment producing noise, non-automatic weighing instruments, personal protective equipment, pressure equipment, pyrotechnics, radio and telecommunications terminal equipment, recreational craft, toys, and simple pressure vessels.
So let's take two examples, one simple and one more advanced and see how to the blockchain could help and disrupt
- Toys Directive. The Directive has requirements on small pieces that can be eaten by children. Manufacturers and importers need to send the necessary documents to notified bodies that carry out some assessments (more on http://CEmarking.net). They then produce a certificate of conformity. Smart contracts would ensure basic requirements are met before the file gets submitted to the Notified body. Everyone would be able to read the data, ensuring transparency e.g. to stakeholders, while at the same time allowing the company to encrypt data in case the company data is private.
Another advantage of blockchain for CEmarking relates to its disintermediation&distributed properties and global value chains. Production and supply chains nowadays are more and more spanning several countries, including non EU countries. Because blockchains are not centralised e.g. in the EU, decentralised elements of the production and supply chain can contribute to the certification process and put in the blockchain their documents certifying compliance. The blockchain provides then a standard mechanism to exchange certification documents across continents and across elements of the value chain or notified bodies.
 
The above Toys example is a simple one. Because it is a simple case, it probably can be made generic so that many uncomplicated CEmarking processes are met with the same blockchain. A more interesting case relates to the Directive for the registration of chemical substances. Imported and manufactured products must be registered when put on the market just like above.. but there is a twist, there is a specific principle :
- REACH Directive. This Directive has a principle called One susbtance One registration. For one substance, all related manufacturers and importers need to agree on how to register the susbtance.  This means sharing costs such as the testing costs (spectrum analysis) and data.  This issue is at the moment a critical issue industry-wise as the number of parties having to agree can amount to thousands. Blockchain would help here because with smart contracts it could ensure that a file is complete and filled by all relevant parties before being submitted. It can enforce a process of agreement.  A second point relevant to blockchain is security. Obviously some chemical susbtances are costly to produce and might relate to trade secrets, e.g. you don't want as a business to share all data. The blockchain would help here because it is a strongly secured mechanism.
 
What do you think of those crazy ideas? :-)

Blockchain as an Enabler for NGI,24 Nov 2017,"It is not a coincidence that the Bitcoin genesis block came into existence in the midst of the financial crisis. Satoshi referred to the blockchain as an alternative to the failing banking system. The financial crisis was followed by a democratic crisis. People around the world sense that the state or European Union as trusted third party, maybe cannot be trusted after all.
The only way blockchain can really change society is, if we use this technology to re-establish our values. If elections can get hacked, blockchain can make them safe again. If people feel unrepresented by politicians, blockchain has the potential to create new forms of groupdecision making. If ownership or personal data is not registered by the state properly, a blockchain can be a safe vault. Blockchain has the possibility to restore norms like the rule of law, liberty and non discrimination. But we need to realise that these norms will not code themselves. They need good blockchain-governance.
In order to better understand the full potential of blockchain technologies, the Dutch Government asked us to set up some blockchain pilots. We started at the beginning of may 2016 and so far we have finished 35 pilotprojects within the Dutch Government: www.blockchainpilots.nl.
We hope to find more governmental or EU organizations who want to work together on specific usecases. We can share prototypes or start new projects together.

Open Internet Initiative,18 Mar 2019,"In 2016, Joshua Cooper Ramo hypothesized the shift from one global Internet to a system of regional Internet blocs, each with distinct characteristics and values, in his book The Seventh Sense (https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Sense-Fortune-Survival-Networks-ebook/dp/...)
In 2019, we can see that world shaping before our eyes:
The American internet.  Laissez-faire, hyper-capitalistic, increasing public authority for private companies, fighting to keep Net Neutrality alive.
On the opposite end of the world, we have the censored Chinese internet.  The international proliferation of China's biggest ventures (WePay, Alibaba, Huawei) and Google's collaboration with the Chinese government look to accelerate its development.
And then, we have the European Internet.  Deploying the GDPR to protect its citizens in the digital space.  Holding businesses accountable when they break the rules (http://fortune.com/2019/01/21/france-fines-google-57-million-for-gdpr-vi...).  Admittedly, dealing with some serious threats -- see Article 11  (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/article-13-and-11-update-even-comp...) and Article 13 (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/german-data-privacy-commissioner-s...) -- but on the whole, Europe is funding innovative and human-centric efforts to create an ethical, open, and fair Internet for the next generation.
[A €50 million fine for Google doesn't seem like much.  But in the words of Ted Waz (https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodore-waz-a069143/), the French courts set a precedent which can now be utilized across 27 other EU countries -- so that €50 million fine can become a  €1.4 billion fine.]
As the strength of a network is based on the number of nodes, Ramo argues that the strength of these (presumably competing) regional Internets will depend on the number of countries they have ""signed on.""  So MENA and Oceania countries will have a chance to chose between the U.S., E.U., and Chinese Internet.  Consequently, whichever regional Internet creates the most attractive Internet architecture for these nations will have the leading network in the world.
Do we want to live in a world where our identities, healthcare, and public services are administered by Facebook?  
What about a world where every moment is tracked and our entire perspective is controlled by a digital police state? (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/massive-database-leak-gives-us-win...)
Or, what about a world designed for *us*?
A world where we control + earn from our personal data. (https://solid.inrupt.com/about)
Where our access to information is limitless, and as a community, we collaborate to protect the integrity (https://crowdfact.io/) of our information landscape.  
Where our leaders prioritize people over unsustainable corporate growth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZnDWu1mnMc#t=04m14s), and our governments embrace technological innovation to improve the common good.
These divergent digital futures are the context of our work today, illustrating the urgency + responsibility we all face in this moment.  
As the Internet dictates more and more of the physical world, the values and characteristics of our Internet will determine the world we experience every day.  
In relation to the regional Internet blocs in the U.S. and China, Europe's rising Internet seems truly aligned with the interests of its people.
That gives us a rare opportunity to shape our world -- and a responsibility to take advantage of it.  
Now is the time for us to determine the values and standards of the European Internet.  We need to embrace the task with diligence and care -- exposing our ideas to scrutiny, identifying our blind spots, and compensating for them as best as we can.  As we validate the values and standards of our future Internet, we need to collaboratively build the technology to support it.  And if we want these values to be the standard for people around the world, we need to invite those people and their nations to join us on the journey.
How does that inform our actions today?
1. With initiatives like the NGI, we start reaching out to communities beyond Europe -- MENA, Africa, Oceania, South America, the Balkans, Southeast Asia -- and involving them in the creation of our Next Generation Internet.
2. When we have those voices at the table, we begin a focused + interdisciplinary dialogue about *specific* values, standards, and visions for the European internet.
At the moment, we're catalyzing open innovation in some main topic areas.  This enables creative solutions -- but in the absence of a clear vision, it's ambiguous whether these solutions will be useful down the road, making the effectiveness of those efforts ambiguous as well.
(Furthermore, we know Facebook + Google have a vision -- e.g. setting up Internet all over Africa, ensuring their digital hegemony -- meaning we have a lot of catching up to do.)
Of course, as an online community of 15,000 people, we shouldn't just shepherd our vision from the Ivory Tower either.
But if we ensure our dialogue is accessible + interdisciplinary, inviting voices from different classes, regions, subject matters, and perspectives to the table, I believe we can avoid reduce the pitfalls of the Ivory Tower, and craft a robust vision for the Next Generation Internet.
Once that vision starts to take place, we can begin identifying *specific* needs for the Next Generation Internet -- and start catalyzing open innovation for those *specific* ends.
(The innovation challenges of Conservation X Labs are a useful reference point -- https://conservationxlabs.com/grand-challenges-for-conservation)
From there, the game is on.

Open Internet Initiative,09 May 2018,"Optimal resource consumption and minimization of carbon emission is a great challenge for the Next Generation Internet. Data centres and networking devices consume significant amount of energy. It is imperative to improve energy efficiency, both locally and at Internet level. Currently there is a significant lack of transparency of environmental cost, which should be urgently resolved given the vast scale of resource usage.
There is a need to provide transparency mechanisms on the environmental cost of the Internet. Identification and tagging of most resource consuming elements is also very important and urgent. The research is needed to figure out the alternatives to improving energy efficiency. This will ensure sustainability of the Internet and of the economy relying on it.

Open Internet Initiative,09 May 2018,"Supporting safety of EU citizens and their data and ensuring the business and social connectivity is the foremost concern in the NGI initiative. The challenge is to provide efficient accountability and security mechanisms for the operational NGI initiative with tamper-proof technical solutions such as security proofs, risk protection, as well as whistle-blowing options and accountability mechanisms. These solutions should ensure high availability of the NGI, counter issues such as sabotage or surveillance, and provide distributed trust mechanisms to remove single points of failure. Given the inherent vulnerability of any single root of trust, there is a preference for distributing trust mechanisms to remove single points of failure, and finding ways to delegate trust in an auditable and controlled way.
Security solutions should also include mechanisms to encourage automating incident and abuse-handling to further enable safe Internet usage during outage. Streamlining and automating how incidents are handled across the highly connected network is an important part of maintaining high availability. This will make the overall system more secure, because it will allow increased responsiveness to changing operational conditions, particularly in time of emergency. The goal should be to improve the trustworthiness and sustainability of the Internet, enabling innovation. This will reduce future cost of security auditing by creating verifiable trustworthiness that cannot be perverted. It will also lower the overall cost of deployment and maintenance while improving responsiveness. 
While building such solutions, we need to follow the technical baseline for cryptographic functionalities. We need to make sure that the higher level technology aspects are not lost to low level hardware incapabilities, e.g. offer Secure Random Number Generation, Secure Key Storage and Cryptographic Acceleration.

Open Internet Initiative,22 Feb 2018," “I cannot think of a better example where interoperability is more important than the Internet of Things. Without interoperability, lights won’t work with the switches, sensors can’t be read by your smartphone, and devices cannot use the networks around them”. - Jari Arkko, former chair, IETF
The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future recognizes interoperability as fundamental to the success of IoT. Interoperability, standards and protocols, and security are all intertwined and essential to the success of IoT. Without them, we face a different kind of fragmentation — where devices and systems simply will not work together. Users will hesitate to adopt IoT if it cannot be integrated with other technologies, it is too complex to easily manage, or if they risk being “locked in” to a particular vendor. McKinsey & Company estimates that “40 percent of the total value that can be unlocked requires different IoT systems to work together”.
The large-scale and widespread innovation prospects of IoT will thrive a race between businesses to be a leader in the space. This pressure to get ahead will bring more and more IoT devices and gateways using proprietary/non-standard technologies into market. This proliferation of proprietary IoT edge will pose a challenge of interoperability between them and rest of the open end-to-end Internet.
IoT will make unprecedented demands on communication infrastructure, data storage, security and privacy, requiring significant investment in upgrading networks, internet addressing and energy supply. In some cases, specialized access networks might be built to support sensors, for example in smart cities, and there will increase demand on networks, energy supply and for Internet addressing. Even in the midst of these challenges, it is essential to give importance to standardized and interoperable solutions to derive the full potential of IoT.

Open Internet Initiative,22 Feb 2018,"In this future technological “renaissance”, will today’s most widely-used online services and platforms deepen their market position, or face competition and possible displacement by new players, a question raised by The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future. The private sector is generally optimistic about a more competitive environment. However, if the Internet platforms of today consolidate their power — becoming dominant across infrastructure, services and applications — user choice and control over their online experience, as well as the availability and diversity of information and content, could be constrained.
Without thriving competition, closed platforms and proprietary ecosystems, or “walled gardens”, may proliferate. Customers may find it difficult to move from one provider or platform to another.  This will result in the loss of choice and constraints on innovation and lead to Internet fragmentation.
“Walled gardens” could also arise as a reaction to political concerns such as economic isolationism and national security, hindering the development of the global economy. Among our community respondents from Africa and Asia reported a significant trend toward greater use of the global, public internet whereas respondents from Europe and North America reported significant trend toward greater use of closed, access-limited, or private IP networks.
How governments should respond, and whether their existing policy tools are adequate, will also be called into question. One Internet Society survey respondent from the Middle East suggested that, “…as governments begin to identify the potential of the Internet, there will be increased regulation for social and economic reasons”.
Scalability is such an important factor in the Internet economy. When current Internet companies like search-engine giants reach such a level of scalability, it will be difficult for others to compete with them. Are you optimistic about the future of Internet economies being open, and conclusive of competition, or do you foresee dominance and “walled gardens” by existing Industry giants?

Open Internet Initiative,22 Feb 2018,"The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future advocates open and voluntary standards as being the core of the Internet’s success. The report also argues that they will, however, be challenged in the future by the speed of Internet innovation, the complexity of the emerging infrastructure and services, and the emergence of proprietary systems and walled gardens. Standards development processes are also under increasing threat from companies that can use their powerful market presence to create de facto standards, bypassing open standards processes and risking fragmentation.
In the words of a technologist from Asia-Pacific Region, the optimism is that so-called Internet of Things which is propagating a move towards proprietary networks and services will fade in significance, as the existing Internet is evolving and expanding with increasing numbers and varieties of connected devices. Successful manufacturers of these devices will have embraced the Internet ecosystem, in terms of open standards, Internet best practices, and appropriate measures to ensure security and longevity of their devices. To summarize, services based on open standards have long contributed to the success on Internet, and this trend is expected to go on.
However, established approaches to formulating Internet standards must also evolve if they are to remain relevant going forward. Simply put, the challenge for established standards organisations and processes includes engaging the innovators who either do not see the benefits of standardisation, or for whom the process of standardisation is too cumbersome.

Open Internet Initiative,22 Feb 2018,"“The Internet will change from end-to-end to edge-to-edge.”
The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future recognizes increasing development at the edge impacting the wider Internet ecosystem. Broadly defined, the edge of the Internet includes both the networks and devices within homes and enterprises, as well as the Internet service provider networks that connect those homes and enterprises to the global Internet. 
There’s shift in a sense that home networks are supporting a growing number of services that extend far beyond the traditional edge of the network. For example, an individual’s home appliances can participate as part of the regional electric power management system, health devices in the home can be connected into remote health monitoring systems, entertainment and personal application data can be stored remotely and accessed seamlessly on demand. These emerging services are delivered by finely-tuned infrastructure that includes specialized networks. This evolving edge is rapidly changing how individuals interact with the Internet, and offers the potential of new and exciting interactive applications and services.
Evolving Edge, however, raises challenges for the current general purpose architecture of the Internet. Growing complexity of specialized networks for purpose built services at edge may create independent islands of connectivity. Businesses to maintain their edge are establishing private networks and private domains to create control for their own business structures. This proliferation of “private” IP-based edge networks that don’t use the “public Internet” is going to increase by orders of magnitude. This could lead to fragmentation of the open, global Internet.
Spurred by increasing innovation at network edge, if specialized networks dominate the connectivity environment, this will create obstacles for innovation and the deployment of new end-to-end services and technologies.

Open Internet Initiative,22 Feb 2018,"“Connectivity and ubiquitous coverage are the backbone of an inclusive new digital world and a prerequisite for a successful further innovation of services online.”
For many end-users, ubiquitous and increasingly robust connectivity has simply become a part of the environment most of the time, and rather the state of being offline has become an exception, as echoed by The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future. It would not have been possible without the widespread deployment of wireless access networks. Mobile access is already the primary way people connect to the Internet in many parts of the world. Devices and people hop from Wi-Fi to cellular networks, and there are use-cases that put a premium on this continuous ubiquitous connectivity. Emerging technologies such as 5G, and new use-cases such as IoT promises to accelerate this trend.
The future of ubiquitous connectivity is not without challenges. Networks have to sustain increasing connectivity and bandwidth demand as result of mushrooming IoT, HD and 4K videos, and on top of that have to encourage yet to be imagined new use-cases. The proliferation of connected systems and wireless devices, will make the network edge more complex, and as a result may lead to specialized and proprietary standards. Therefore, it is also essential to focus on development and deployment of open standards that facilitate interoperability so that people can roam seamlessly across different wireless technologies.

Legislation and the legislative process are recurring themes in the sources. The key elements for legislation can be seen in following Figure:

Legislation
It is usual that citizens and businesses are ahead of governments in understanding the implications of Internet, and overall conclusion is that the legislative process must reform to adapt to the speed that technology evolves at. Changes are rapid, so legislation must adapt. [PSNC-2017]
In order to make legislation keep pace with technology, various solutions are proposed. Takahashi-2017, suggests that AI could provide automation to speed up the legislative process, however on the other hand, as suggested by Net-Future-2017, interdisciplinary approaches will be required to determine legislation for new technology, especially when legislating for safety critical and applications with high social impact. It was advocated to consult as many people as possible through the new methods of E-Participation and smart consultation. Such consultation techniques will engage more citizens quickly. Multidisciplinary teams should also work together to determine appropriate legislation for safety critical applications of technology so that both the technical, application, ethical and legal perspectives are considered.

Hyper-connected Sociality,16 Jan 2018,"Another widespread concern, raised in Hub4NGI D2.1, is the abuse of Internet technologies causing threats or limitations to democracy and liberty.
In an online article titled ""Will we still have a single global internet in 2025?"", the Ditchley Foundation also mentioned that the authoritarian governments wish to use the capabilities of the Internet to exert controls over citizens and keep their data at home in order to ensure access.
Governments are aiming to regularise the Internet and ensuring prosperity. As depicted in a report of the CSaP Policy Workshop on NGI, States are working to enforce the data localization laws, which require companies to store their customers' and employees' data locally.
According to a recent study and analysis by Lipparini & Romeo (2017), the democracy is seen to be under threat in such a way that electorate can be manipulated via the power of the Internet as a source of big data and as a broadcast medium. The study points out that the governments and tech-companies may collide with each other to spy on citizens and implement social control.
On the other hand there is a trade-off between regulations towards social control and privacy protection. Applying the ""hard regulations"" against fake news, may imply the risk of censorship and social control which may violate some of the human values such as social liberty and privacy. This trade-off is highlighted in the Overton's report, and a multidisciplinary approach is highly recommended to balance between the human rights and legislation.
The Hub4NGI D2.1 also raised some of the issues and challenges in this context along with some recommendations. It is advocated to enforce regulations on search engines so that they produce more balanced results. However, on the other hand, users may not want this. They may prefer to get results that agree with their opinions and preferences. If more ""objective"" results are returned, the user's perspective may be that their search experience is worse than before. Citizens’ social groups should not be interfered with, unless there are genuine reasons (such as illegal activity). Many citizens want to interact with like-minded people, and clearly in a liberal society, this should not be prevented.
Promoting inclusiveness (e.g. broadband for all) and diversity (e.g. heterogeneity and multidisciplinary discourse) is a possible partial solution, but citizens cannot be forced into diversity. All citizens must have equal rights in the digital society. As the companies and individuals all are increasingly demand for fast broadband therefore there should be the right infrastructure in place in order to ensure that the citizens and organizations are not discriminated [Lipparini & Romeo 2017]. Multidisciplinary research is needed in order to answer questions relating to the state control and liberty.

Multidisciplinary research is needed in order to answer questions relating to the promotion of information diversity and truth in the Internet. Many of these questions relate to the causes of limited or biased information and how the information can be made less biased or more complete. Examples of causes include unbalanced search results from Internet search providers that tune the results to users’ previous searches or preferences; restrictions on Internet search results through interventions by authoritarian governments; the current high-profile of “fake news” (is the news really fake or is someone merely accusing it of being fake?); and social groups that pursue a particular agenda by reinforcing certain arguments, ignoring other opinions.
These questions raise other questions of jurisdiction, state control and liberty, and a question overarching them all is: what levels of intervention are acceptable before liberty is compromised?

As the Internet economy evolves over the next ten years, fuelled by innovations in technology and business models,  advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain could bring about an industrial and technological “renaissance”, and only those who adapt quickly to technological change will be successful. The pace of this technological change will dramatically accelerate as IoT, AI, and blockchain technologies are fully deployed. Governments will need to increase spending on training programs to help workers impacted by technological displacement. The growth of IoT will effectively make all companies technology companies. This shift to greater dependency on technology will be accompanied by new security concerns. As one Internet Society survey respondent in North America noted, “Losing control of your data is catastrophic today. Tomorrow, it could mean the death of your business”.

The key elements of multidisciplinary design are shown in the following Figure.

Multidisciplinary Design Elements
Results from the FIRE STUDY Next Generation Internet (NGI) Digital Innovation Networks Consultation involving a Delphi Study with an expert panel emphasized the importance of multidisciplinary and end-to-end design. More than 50% of survey participants opined that the multidisciplinary approach should be the main policy recommendation for the NGI experimentation. Realising the all-and-always connected vision of the Next Generation Internet Experimentation System, the multidisciplinary approach will help in facing a number challenges. Bringing together people, data, devices in a variety of deployment scenarios will require end-to-end experimentation to be driven by combining expertise from different technology domains (e.g. wireless networks, optical networks, cloud computing, IoT, data science etc.) in relation to specific vertical sector needs (health care, creative media, smart transport, marine industry etc.) and horizontal disciplines push factors (e.g. psychology, law, sociology, arts, economics)[FIRE Study DIN 2017].
With the advancement speed of new technologies, the governance to legislation has become an ongoing process therefore multidisciplinary teams are deemed necessary. Hybrid teams of technical experts and lawyers will help ensure that legislation is relevant and implemented effectively [Takahashi 2017].
The Hub4NGI D2.1 emphasis that multidisciplinary teams are particularly suited to supporting end-to-end systems design, due to its heterogeneous nature, from edge computing, through networks to processing and application design. Participatory design patterns such as co-design and co-creation involving user communities and citizens are seen as part of end-to-end systems design. In turn, end-to-end design is supported by interoperability and open standards. Interoperability and open standards are clearly important to enabling end-to-end system design, and therefore should be encouraged and supported.

"The Next Generation Internet: Diversity, Inclusion and Skills",18 Nov 2017,"R U - I o T Ready?
The catchphrase, R U - I o T Ready? has raised some interesting questions such as, What is IoT? Why should I care? and What does ""Ready"" mean?
What is IoT? I will use this simple definition of IoT from Webopedia
The Internet of Things refers to the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address for Internet connectivity, and the communication that occurs between these objects and other Internet-enabled devices and systems. I will add to this definition ""for Human-Centric Solutions.""
More definitions here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things
Why should I care?  In this last month's article Change Agents Impacting Building & Facility Management - Marc Petock, provides this wisdom,  IoT continues as a game changer; it is changing what we are delivering---how, when and where. However, realizing its potential starts with understanding the value and contribution it brings.  IoT is as much about behavioral changes and business opportunity, not just technology. We need to operate and manage buildings based on outcomes, not output.  IoT is not the objective of this transformation but the platform upon which to connect, collect and analyze data so we can measure and validate these outcomes. Building owners and operators should not “buy” IoT; they should purchase solutions to specific problems where IoT components are part of a solution.
What does ""Ready"" mean? Being ready is being able to discuss the merits of IoT and applied them to our applications for human-centric solutions. 
When I originally created the catchphrase, I was thinking the question was focused on our traditional smart automated building industry but now have come to understand it is not just our industry that needs to be IoT ready. Those who are the reason for our human-centric solutions needed to be part of the discussion, education, and solution and made IoT ready. This process of developing inclusive solutions requires us all to think more like app developers creating our human-centric solutions as discussed earlier in this column
http://www.contractormag.com/iot/human-centric-building-automation
Those who identify themselves as the IoT industry need to get ready by better understanding the slow dynamics and change agents of our smart automated buildings industry. I prepared this timeline of industry evolution last month including Marc comments to improve understanding of our industry's history and its (sometimes) painfully slow evolution.
IoT folks need to review the last 20 year plus timeline to understand better that this is not a race for IoT to win but more of a fun run where traditional controls and new IoT folks will gather to discover each other's strengths and build on them for the greater good.
As as an industry, we need to stop the waste of time in this creation of them and us, we are all in this together it is not a war, it is a love-in ""for Human-Centric Solutions.""
Our opportunity is 2B IoT-Ready and uses our combined knowledge to gracefully and purposefully connect humans to our large inventory of existing soulless buildings in North America.
This post provides insight to the why you need 2B IoT Ready, Finding Generation IoT: New Talent for a New Era. We are experiencing a worldwide scramble for IoT-capable staff.
Why is it mandatory that we be IoT ready?
It is mandatory, because the next big thing about to land is what I am calling IoT ready.
From Harbor Research - Machine Intelligence Through Data Transformation
Aggregation, transformation, and management of data from sensors, machines, and equipment is the holy grail of machine learning and the IoT; a fundamental core enabler
The fact that a wide range of sensors, machines, and equipment can transmit information about status, performance, and usage, and can interact with people and other devices anywhere in real time points to the increasingly complex role of data in IoT systems. This only compounds when we consider the many billions or more of networked devices that many observers are forecasting will be deployed and the scale of data they will produce. Gathering and analyzing machine data is not a role for human beings. The only way to achieve it is to have the product’s own “machine intelligence” continually delivered back to its creator. This requires three things: 
More and more my thoughts are being formed my observations reflected and shared in my daily posting on twitter of what IoT ready might included.

Big Data and analytics is something we have been talking about for a while, and we are either using it, providing it, or selling it. At this stage of the game, it has created a business opportunity that many have embraced. Someone has to connect the data to some form of filtering or to an analytics platform to make the data useful. But what happens when data no longer needs a human interaction?

With open, trusted and personalised learning solutions that optimise digital learning and allow users to engage and interact with content and with peers. 
A digital learning incubator will ensure European citizens have the same digital learning opportunities:
   - by extending personalised learning across society, regardless of age, gender and other socio-economic factors.
   - by increasing the number of distributed learning solutions for children with special educational needs.
   - by improving opportunities for start-ups and SMEs taking to market new personalised and inclusive learning solutions. 
The European next generation internet initiative will help unleash these opportunities through the Work Programme 2018-2020: ICT-30-2019-2020. It will do this in two ways: through an Innovation Action rolling out a Digital Learning Incubator and a Coordination and Support Action in the area of Digital Learning.
Among other things, the Innovation Action will comprise multi-stakeholder alliances that can jointly achieve fast-paced breakthroughs in personalised and inclusive learning online.
The Coordination and Support Action will pinpoint emerging research challenges from digital certification of learning outcomes and blockchain technologies and their uptake for a more inclusive and personalised learning experience.

"The Next Generation Internet: Diversity, Inclusion and Skills",31 Oct 2017,"The NGI Networking Session on NGI Skills and Education at the NGI Forum 2017 asked two key questions about the future of education:
1. How can education help the next generation internet? What skills will citizens and workers need?
2. How might NGI change the nature of education in schools and universities? 
Current education systems give the same education to all children and students but do they still need to learn handwriting and basic maths?
The NGI will be key to customising education globally so each child has their own learning path no matter where they are in the world. 
The NGI can also support crowdsourced research, an environment where students come up with bright new ideas and push them out to the internet for others to take forward and create new communities around the ideas.
But what about identity, safety and privacy? Children will need to handle not just their physical identity but also their online identity, and information that could remain online potentially for a long time. Most importantly, they need to understand the terms and conditions of using the internet so it works for them, not against them. 
In this video, John Domingue, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University, shares the main takeaways from the Networking Session..

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,22 Feb 2018,"Complementary to the evolving network edge, the traditional hierarchy of backbone, access and enterprise networks is flattening, as echoed by The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future. In the past, this hierarchy meant that backbone networks would exchange, or transit, traffic destined for access networks they did not directly connect. However, the increasing use of CDNs and the continuous growth of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), where traffic is often passed directly to access networks, have reduced the need for transit traffic. Geoff Huston, Chief Scientist at APNIC, referred to this as “the death of transit”.
While these changes improve experience for end-users by reducing latency and jitter, and lower costs  for large-scale service providers, the cost of implementing capabilities such as CDNs and other close-to-the-edge service points puts smaller or emerging service providers at disadvantage. For example, large on-demand video providers can establish caches close to their users to provide better quality service while smaller providers are unable to do so. This trend may lead to consolidation and reduced competition in service offerings.
The potential implications therefore include reduced innovation in long haul networks and lack of choice for consumers. Internet infrastructure and economy will be at risk of being dominated by larger players having capability to invest at the edge unlike SMEs and start-ups, preventive of a healthy competitive ecosystem and next generation of permission-less innovation.

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,22 Feb 2018,"“IoT compounds every security problem ever seen and multiplies every problem of the Internet. Your toaster could be sending out spam.” -Technologist, North America
Connected devices add enormous complexity to an already complex security environment. They also raise the stakes, as with high convergence and influence of Internet into our lives, there is increased potential in cyber threats to damage physical assets and harm human life. The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future identifies the root of the problem being de-prioritization of security over IoT innovation, we are adopting IoT faster than we can secure it.
The case of Mirai attack of 2016 is often taken up to prove the extent of damage mere plug-and-play remotely-managed IoT devices can have on the broader Internet. Many of these devices on the market today have very limited built-in security measures, and will not be updated through the devices’ lifetime. Furthermore, explosion in the requirement of such connected devices in transportation, health, smart homes and many other domains alter the entire landscape of cyber threats. An agreement on IoT Security frameworks and best practices is essential to safeguard safety and realize full potential of IoT.
The role of government cannot be undermined; more risk there is to critical infrastructure from connected devices, the greater the perceived need for governments to intervene. If the threats arise from something as innocent as an Internet connected light bulb, the government will be tempted to regulate the Internet. But similar to the events in the past, there is a fear that will government responsive respectful of privacy and individual autonomy. All stakeholders, apart from government, from users to manufacturers, will need to be more security aware and work together towards a more comprehensive and resilient security environment. The insurance industry, for example, may exert market influence, for example, by requiring systems or devices to have security certifications in order for their owners to be insurable.
We need to address IoT-related security issues before we can realize the full benefits of the Internet economy. A sustainable and effective long-term solution will require ongoing collaboration, and a commitment by manufacturers and service providers to incorporate privacy and security in their design processes, from initial conception to long-term support and updates.

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,22 Feb 2018,"A small number of major companies may further concentrate their power by absorbing potential threats or new opportunities. The reach and resources of Internet platforms mean that start-ups will be acquired in their infancy, before they can disrupt the bigger players. Will the idea of permissionless innovation and the notion that anyone can start the new “Google” still be realistic, are the broad questions addressed by The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future.
That said, innovation and new services on the Internet often develop and move faster than anyone can predict. Economic growth and business opportunity will increasingly depend on a dynamic and innovative Internet, which, in turn, will depend on open interoperable standards and permissionless innovation. This demand for continuous innovation by industry, users and even government may mean that even today’s large Internet platforms will face fierce competition from emerging players, including those outside the traditional ICT sector.
A new generation of entrepreneurs coming online from emerging countries has the opportunity to use technology to solve local problems, reach global markets and drive innovation. As more people benefit from coming online in the next five to ten years, the opportunities and funding for entrepreneurs and start-ups will grow locally and globally. Start-ups will be able to scale more quickly, accelerating past the traditional path of company growth. And as Internet growth shifts from the historically strong digital economies in North America and Europe to emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa, new innovation leaders and technology hubs will emerge. These new entrepreneurs should play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the Internet economy.
The question is if smaller entrepreneurs are going to be able to compete, or get caught up in an uncertain environment of investment and competition from big conglomerates?

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,22 Feb 2018,"“Countries need to enhance their industrial policies and consumer protection frameworks to prepare for IoT … National IoT frameworks will also need to incorporate cultural considerations that will impact IoT development.”

Internet of Things is putting more and more things on the Internet empowered by ubiquitous connectivity, increasing bandwidth and sensor technology. IoT is not just limited to this extended Internet infrastructure, but as well includes applications and services deriving some useful functions from the connected devices, with future promising AI enabled advanced interaction with connected objects through voice and gesture, and virtual and augmented reality experiences through data generated by IoT.
With this development, we are approaching a state where Internet will be integrated into every walk of our life. This convergence of the physical and digital worlds, as Internet will be used to control much of our objects and environment, will bring many opportunities but would also profoundly impact all sectors of our society and economy, as addressed by The Internet Society 2017 report- Paths to our Digital Future.
It may reduce mundane tasks, freeing workers to focus on creative, non-routine aspects of their jobs. But, as convergence gains momentum, every industry faces disruption that may change or even destroy jobs.
IoT brings a convergence of ICT and traditional analogue industries such as manufacturing firms, increasing the competition between two, and also evolving the current dynamics of Internet economy.
Current landscape of industry-specific regulatory frameworks is not well suited in a changing world in where connectivity blurs the lines between sectors of the economy. The challenge for policymakers and government will be twofold: one, to avoid falling further behind technological change; and two, to avoid disproportionate and potentially harmful regulations in response to evolving security threats.
With IoT, there will be risk of mass surveillance, potentially harmful insights by curating and analysing user data, thus profoundly impacting privacy as a result.
While lives may be improved by smart homes and smart cities, IoT is such a disruptive technology that it can impact many walks of human life. Therefore, its effects should be foreseen, and safeguards put in place to check any profound negative impact on economy, privacy, and society.

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,21 Feb 2018,"Although it is commented by some that AI projection is just a marketing hype, however many in industry and governments believed that the role of AI is pervasive in the future Internet economy. AI presents enormous opportunities to create new jobs, new industries and new ways of connecting. At the same time many believed that AI would steal thousands of jobs. The nature of work will drastically change as the AI and automation drive significant structural change across industries. This change will empower workers and minimize the inequalities among people and between countries. Many existing jobs may be displaced as AI moves beyond monetising user data to changing how products and services are delivered. Adapting to the pace of change will be a major global challenge for the immediate future. AI could be a partner in human intelligence, letting us take on and solve much bigger challenges. As one survey respondent explained, “The distance between people’s brains and the Internet will become ever smaller, and the interface between the two ever more sophisticated” [ISOC report on “Paths to our Digital Future” 2017].
Because of the AI, there will be huge gains in scientific research, transportation and delivery of services. With the help of open source development, AI has the potential to diminish the difference between developed and developing worlds. For example, a country that relies on agricultural production could use AI to analyse crop yields and optimise food production. AI applications in healthcare could be a game changer for disease detection in low income areas.
Does the global society has made itself ready to absorb the change, and prepared for new economy and new business models? The intelligence and services used to manage and implement manufacturing or services may still reside in developed countries rather than being developed locally. AI might exacerbate the digital divide in significant ways that would have geopolitical implications.

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,21 Feb 2018,"The rise of nationalism and populism around the globe could cause governments build national policy barriers that fragment the Internet. If current trends are any indication, more and more governments will restrict and control Internet use and access through censorship, network shutdowns and other means. This is a matter of great concern and is highlighted in the ISOC report on “Paths to our Digital Future” released in 2017. This report raised the questions related to globalization and the domestic pressures that need to be answered before we go ahead with the future Internet:
Will governments embrace globalisation, or will they respond to domestic pressures to strengthen both physical and cyber borders?
Will they support and promote multistakeholder approaches to policy, or will they retrench behind the walls of multilateralism?
Globalisation could pull Governments to become more attuned to the need for cross-border and cross-sector cooperation on cyber threats like crime and terrorism. The complexity of the challenges should compel governments to work with other stakeholders. However, for such efforts to work and to have legitimacy, they will need to move beyond traditional public-private partnerships and include civil society.
The governments need to support multistakeholder approaches particularly when it comes to setting norms and best practices for cyberspace. But because of the slow political process the tension between multilateralism and multistakeholderism will continue for the foreseeable future.
The ISOC report throws a question about the use of multi-stakeholder approaches in the future. It also questions whether civil society groups and activists will have a real seat at the table. The answer to this question will have significant implications for the future of online rights and freedoms. The report mentioned the pressing need for new models of Internet governance in this evolving multipolar world. These new diverging models will be able to shape the global Internet and its core principles. If the international system continues to turn inwards, the implications for the global Internet will become ever more profound.

Socio-economic and Legal Considerations for NGI,21 Feb 2018,"In the ISOC report on “Paths to Our Digital Future” released in 2017, it is believed that the Internet should empower users with certain abilities which must remain at the heart of the Internet experience for everyone and everywhere. The users must be able to connect, speak, innovate, share, choose and trust.
Like civil society, with the evolution of the digital society and the expansion of the Internet into our economy, governments need to be more active as policymakers. From cybersecurity to societal issues to technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), governments will face a host of new and complex issues that might challenge all aspects of their decision-making. The pressure of security challenges is therefore growing the future of Internet is highly dependent on how the governments respond to this issue.
On the other hand, as there’s a mix of public and private sector services, the roles of responsibilities among governments and private sector is blurred and complicated.
Could this result in the private sector assuming responsibilities that are traditionally those of governments’?
If so, will they be subject to the same accountability and governance mechanisms as governments? In the future Internet economy, the use of IoT and artificial intelligence will increase the need to be vigilant about transparency and accountability in decision-making and governance. With the increase in the more complicated relationships between public and private sectors, transparency and accountability will also be needed to understand and manage.
To what extent, do governments need to work with the new business models and technologies?
Legislation process needs to be accelerated to keep pace with the technological developments. There will be ever increasing pressure on governments to act with the pace of change. Are governments prepared for the drastic changes in the economy, especially in traditional industries most challenged by technology? Government’s tendency to apply legacy regulatory models to new and emerging issues is of particular concern.

The Hub4NGI D2.1 pointed out that the Internet has changed the market dynamics. Only the companies doing service innovation might survive. The major elements of economics and wealth distribution are shown in the following Figure:

Economics and Wealth Distribution
The proliferation of AI and automation is becoming a major threat to human employment. As the machines will take over certain tasks in the economy, there is a need to find new ways of distributing wealth. 70% of European citizens agree that robots and artificial intelligence are going to steal peoples' job in near future [Lipparini & Romeo 2017]. Before it would happen, we need to find the answers to these questions:
How can human and machines coexist in the economy?
What roles are humans ideally suited for and what roles are machines best at?
How can humans' livelihood be sustained?
How can machines be paid for?
How the autonomous machines be legislated?
Should robots and AI be legible to pay taxes?
How to support SMEs in the new Internet economy?
What alternative business models exist to challenge the dominance of the incumbents?
Compared to other business types, SMEs are seen to be at a disadvantage and need help to take advantage of NGI. Investment policies and legislations should aim to increase the abilities of SMEs to profit from NGI technologies. Furthermore, new business models are needed to challenge the current dominance of the large incumbents.

Innovation Networks,04 May 2018,"NGI Interim Study Report on analysing stakeholder input found Safeguarding Openness to new Entrants to be an essential feature of future human-centric sustainable Internet. The following 4 aspects of safeguarding openness were identified.
Unlocking New Verticals:  Countermeasures are required in NGI against market dominance and lack of choice and control in application domains critical to the users. One of the ways it can be achieved is through suitable microscale alternatives based on open source, open standards, thus dissolving the dependency on hyperscale giants.
	 
​Preventing Horizontal Spillover: For reducing the dominance and near complete dependency, take-over of strategic markets by dominant players from related fields should be avoided in NGI.
	 
Improving low-level discovery: Unbiased and unmediated search, and direct discoverability of services and content offered should be provided for where possible.
	 
End-user capabilities with open spectrum (specific to 5G): Adequate end-user controlled radio spectrum should be made available as it allows for grass roots innovation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Openness to new entrants in NGI can be enabled by making it simpler to create services and by unlocking dominant positions in application domains strategically important to the users, which is hampering development and innovation. Freedom of use is ensured by mechanisms supporting open access, such as stimulating the offering of scalable shared mechanisms to support multi-cultural needs, like multilingual use and local content i.e. availability of ICT in every language – driven by the needs of the language communities rather than business decisions. The strict enforcement of Net-Neutrality must be the legal requirements which means that no type of internet usage shall be discriminated against by access providers. This openness drives sustainability of the NGI while enabling diverse creativity and innovation.

Innovation Networks,23 Jan 2018,"Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable advocates Innovation Support as the process of helping applied research output that addressed some real-world problems turnaround into a product or service to the needs of some users.
Referencing Nurse [Nurse 2015] throughout, the deliverable presents the process of innovation as a journey from pure research to applied research and finally to a finished product. Applied research aims at achieving specific outcomes and is directed towards addressing real world problems. The pre-requisite therefore to applied research are understanding of the needs of the target user community together with a sufficiently well-developed knowledge base of the subject area which is strengthened by the pure (or discovery) research. Once the applied research results in proving the utility of a technology for a particular application, thereafter innovation is materialized, as results are developed into a marketable product or service and tested in real world conditions. Following figure demonstrates the interpreted innovation lifecycle from Nurse [Nurse 2015].

Innovation Lifecycle
As also evident from the above innovation lifecycle, the research process does not have to always follow a liner direction from research to applied research and finally to product. Knowledge can be acquired from applied research and give clues to further discovery research.
The deliverable also investigates that there is a gap between applied research outputs and product and service development due to the traditional ways the two activities are funded. Applied research is often funded by public money (e.g. EC or national grants), and product development is often funded by private money (e.g. venture capital for entrepreneurs). This gap is addressed by so called Innovation Agencies. Glennie & Bound describe 4 major types of innovation agencies after surveying and analysing 10 national Innovation Agencies, e.g. Innovate UK, DARPA (USA) and Tekes (Finland): (i) Market and System Fixer (fix failings in the market that mean innovations are not getting through), (ii) Industry Builders (developing and nurturing a particular industry sector), (iii) Mission Drivers (create innovation to solve recognised problems), (iv) System Optimiser (mixing the three above strategy types).
The deliverable recommends that innovation support be guided by the approaches taken by national Innovation Agencies, as these have proven track record in generating opportunity that has transferred into viable and sustainable businesses, creating strong bodies of expertise and strengthening their respective national economies.

Innovation Networks,21 Jan 2018,"Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable, citing DIN Forum 2017, defines evidence platforms as places where researchers can share, store as well as search data and models, where solutions to problems can be archived and possibly made available. Evidence bases thus provide a platform for innovation as through sharing data and models, people and other stakeholders can collaborate, identify new ideas and test existing ones. The deliverable, however, argues that such a single integrated platform providing sum functionality of data and solutions to problem is not available, though individual functions are independently available as briefed next.
For evidence platforms to be effective, it is important that the practice of open science or Open Research Data (ORD) is promoted to which both EC and the OECD have investigated mechanisms. EC consultation resulted in the Public Consultation on Science 2.0  with the name Science 2.0 now being replaced by open science, which investigated how science needed to change given new technologies and changes in attitudes, so as to reinforce science’s core principles of openness, transparency and reproducibility. The OECD has also determined its policy to clarify and support open science. Asserting that science should be a global public good, accessible by and for the benefit of all humankind, it accordingly defines open science as including open access to (i) scientific publications, (ii) research data, (iii) digital applications and source code, (iv) scientists, the public and commercial companies.
Royal Society in concurring with the Public Consultation on Science 2.0, highlighted that science has benefited from open practices throughout history and openness should be default for science. In keeping up this practice, making science data open enables the public to more easily engage in the results and process of science, also arguing that data-intensive science is becoming a driver of economic growth and development. The deliverable giving example of Zenodo stems out that scientific community also has clear will to support open research data. Fed4FIRE+ D2.1 deliverable [Taylor 2017] investigates Zerodo from the point of view of an experimentation platform.
Other than ORD repositories to store and curate results of scientific experiments, DIN Forum 2017 advocated that sharing knowledge on problem solving would also have additional benefits to support the innovation community quoting “often the cost of looking for solutions to problems is so great or the search intractable, that we resort to making our own solution instead of finding other peoples”. The deliverable gave example of Stack Overflow as a popular forum for persisting solutions to programming problems, and raised an open question to identify such forums in other important domains as well.
Apart from open data and solutions to problems, PSNC 2017 identified open public data as also being important specifically for start-ups. The deliverable summarized by realisinig the need to survey and forms a directory of platforms that provide above functions. Additionally, if there is any value in integrating these functions and platforms together over the integration Google search currently provides.

Innovation Networks,21 Jan 2018,"Experimentation Platforms are strongly advocated as an important component of NGI innovation. The Fire Study reinforces this, emphasizing that heterogeneous, integrated and real-world experimentation environments or resources are important, as their inclusion early in the validation and end-to-end testing of new protocols and services incorporates fast feedback. The study goes on to recommend that new experimentation areas should open up to “include a pan European blockchain, including robotic devices, and the establishment of mixed experimentation environments with large numbers of heterogeneous devices with IoT programmability, and Large Scale Streams”.
PSNC workshop on NGI concurs with the above described recommendations of The Fire Study. The workshop adds that since it is expensive many a times to validate end-to-end real-life functioning of a service or product especially for start-ups, easy and affordable access to experimentation infrastructure (hardware, software, clouds) and resources should be provided as a service. This can be particularly true for new and upcoming technologies like blockchain.
The Fire Study also supports existing pattern of open calls and experimentation funding targeted towards attracting innovative SMEs and start-ups to test new networks/protocols, and enable prototyping for rapid innovations. Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable also recommends that in addition to the current open calls, the experimentation funding mechanisms offer flexible funding to accommodate SMEs that need experimentation in short order. This can be achieved through means like Responsive mode funding – where applications can be made at any time with each being judged on its own merits rather than against other applicants, and fast turnaround of experimentation funding decisions.
Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable recognizes heterogeneous experimentation platforms as important element for innovation in NGI related themes.

Innovation Networks,21 Jan 2018,"Hub4NGI D2.1 deliverable determines Innovation Networks as an important theme for the NGI Initiative, and therein considers the collaboration spaces as an essential network infrastructure to foster innovation in NGI related issues. As a starting point, it defines collaboration spaces as places where stakeholders concerned with the future of Internet can interact and share ideas be it physical places (incubators, etc.) or virtual (Internet forums).
To stress on the importance and need for collaboration spaces, the document includes evidence from Large-scale survey of European citizens study which acknowledges that more efforts are needed at European, national, and local levels to create spaces and places where citizens, stakeholders, and policy makers could exchange on the future of NGI related issues. Nurse [Nurse 2015]  also highlights the importance of facilitating collaboration in highly interconnected research system space quoting that “most effective research systems are characterised by freedom of movement and action.”
For collaboration spaces to be effective, citing 2017 DIN Forum Report, the document asserts the need for them to be wider than simply places for people to interact, suggesting to incorporate other infrastructure types such as social networks, evidence platforms and experimentation platforms potentially bringing in open scientific data to the space. If all these platforms are brought together, there will be spaces for collaboration of people and resources from different disciplines, so that they may create and apply new and existing technologies to real world problems.
