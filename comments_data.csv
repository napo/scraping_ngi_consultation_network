About trustworthy information & manipulation of information

""Trustworthy online information infrastructures"" is one of the ten challenges identified for a more inclusive, democratic and resilient internet by the Engineroom project and reported in this blog post https://www.ngi.eu/news/2018/10/22/ten-challenges-for-the-internet/.
One of the biggest scalps of the unbridled growth of the internet is probably the health of our media ecosystems: profits for quality journalism have cratered, and the ad-driven business models supporting information provision online have empowered the sensational over nuance, clicks over truth. The proliferation of “fake news” and the weaponisation of information is a key challenge for the internet today, threatening the very building blocks of our democracies and societies. Ensuring access to trustworthy information, and preventing the deliberate manipulation of information flows without resorting to censorship and hampering of freedom of speech remains an unsolved challenge. We need to not just think more about specific, particularly media-friendly, topics such as fake news, deepfakes, filter bubbles and Twitter bots, but take a wider view in thinking about how we can create healthy (social) media ecosystems and create viable alternative business models for quality news and information sharing.

Some of the questions they are asking:
The million dollar question: how can we make online quality journalism profitable? Which business models actually work, and how can we support them?
We heralded the internet as the great democratiser, giving everyone a stage- also those who we might have preferred not to (extreme political views, trolls, harassment). How do we strike the right balance between freedom of expression and addressing threats to our the resilience of our societies and individual safety?
‘Fake news’ has already proven very hard to counter- certainly technological fixes such as AI-detection, appear to be only limited in their effectiveness. How will we deal with the next-generation of manipulation tools, such as deepfake technologies?
We also invite you to read and comment about the recent ""Acosta affair"" https://consultation.ngi.eu/channels/discovery-and-identification-techno... can NGI technology help us identify whether a video has been tampered with?

Open Source: Challenges for Citizens

European funding is mandating projects to delivers everything in open source, especially as we move into Horizon Europe starting in 2021, where it will be mandatory to deliver project results in open source.  Participants at the Networking Session pointed out a few challenges for citizens in this respect:
- Open source applies to those who can handle the code and research results that could be in code. However, for a citizen, they must be able to use the code wherever they are, even after the project ends. There needs to be the capability and wherewithal to deploy the new programs with new data after the project concludes. The algorithms need to be able to be reused again and again and this must be built into the research and innovation projects, and for this to happen, there needs to be another layer added to enable this. The COMPASS project is looking how to develop this layer. COMPASS project

Yes, cybersecurity is the major challenge

I suggest that let's keep the Internet collaborative or rather cooperative in terms of security. This implies security incident sharing, uququitous evidence collection, aggregation of evidence, repuation based methods of resource allocation and immediate automatic trace back of all malicious activity. We have proposed a cooperative security architecture in re2ee.org to do all this. The solution can be deployed one network at a time and is backwards compatible with the current Internet. Naturally, benefits increase with wider deployment.

In summary: ""data"" is the central concept in the dominant narrative (""Data is the new gold; the web is a mine""). As long as we discuss in terms of the frame of our self-chosen opponents, we've half lost the battle!

In terms of control and information, knowledge is power or how was it?
We need to agree on the terms that gives us back some of that control and question ourself if we like a determistic world or a place where free will and opportunity is not categorized or boxed in. The protocols developed with blockchain technology surface these problems and shows us how vertical, proprietary silos operate and a organizational singularity has always been there just like Adam Smith invisible hand. As a power that opens up and as the world of information technology showed us how open stack or open source by time, is superior the closed systems. But the idea of comparing to Adam Smith perhaps can be valued based on how fragmentation of new innovations emerge or how coordination can be incentivised. I have so far not read or grasped theories from any classical or neo economist or social scientist. The only ones succeded in putting words to this is the cryptocommuity. Which has showed its behaviours. Please use your academic knowledge to help and guide me develop my thuoghts further on!

How about ISOC, ICANN, IAB, DNS, TLS certificates, and all that?

I can see that the analysis above addresses mostly economic problems at the applications space.  However, is the NGI at all interested in how the underlying infrastructure is administered, including the roles of ISOC, ICANN, IAB, etc.  For example, would there be any point to consider how the Domain Name System (DNS), root certificate management in browsers, etc, create centralised or less centralised control points in the network?  Or is NGI only interested in things happening in the cloud and social media domain?

Responsible AI,04 Jan 2018 15:35,Will AI Kill Us Or Empower Us? TED Talk Experts Weigh In,"
Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence

Hi Rob,
I came across this really insightful article by Jeremy Epstein on the potential of blockchain in helping us keep #AI under control and ownership of our data. Below, is a summary from Jeremy's article, including some early pioneering work on blockchain-based AI.
There are three essential layers to AI: the data repository; the algorithm/machine learning engine; the AI interface.
If you are going to trust your decision-making to a centralised AI source, you need to have 100 percent confidence in:
- The integrity and security of the data (are the inputs accurate and reliable, and can they be manipulated or stolen?)
- The machine learning algorithms that inform the AI (are they prone to excessive error or bias, and can they be inspected?)
- The AI’s interface (does it reliably represent the output of the AI and effectively capture new data?)
In a centralised, closed model of AI, you are asked to implicitly trust in each layer without knowing what is going on behind the curtains.
The results can be alarming, even totally unacceptable in a democratic society. Reports by the New York Times and Wired cover the use of a proprietary machine-learning system called COMPAS, which is used by courts in many parts of the U.S. and which  actually recommends longer prison sentences for blacks than whites, with all other data points being equal.
The AI makes racially-biased decisions, but no one can inspect it, and the company that makes it will not explain it. It’s closed, it is hidden, and models like these are in the hands of big, powerful companies with no incentive to share them or reveal how they work.
Blockchain + AI
Over time, more and more data will flow into blockchains. This is expected to reduce the big data advantage that the FANGs, BATs, and Fortune 1000 have over the little people.
Several projects have now been set up to reward people through cryptographic tokens for making their data available through a decentralised marketplace. The hope is that it could lead to ever-more accurate AI models and the ability to create valuable conversational user interfaces, all with the trust and transparency that blockchains offer.
Blockchain-based AI projects are still in the early stage of development, but let's take a look at some of the pioneering ones to get an idea of where they might take us:
1. Ocean Protocol: decentralised data exchange protocol and network that incentivizes the publishing of data for use in the training of artificial intelligence models.
2. Singularity Net: aims to be the first AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) blcockhain-based marketplace.
3. SEED: a project aimed at giving us the confidence that we can actually trust the bots in our lives. It's an open-source, decentralised network where any and all bot interactions can be managed, viewed, and verified.

Inspiration from ""Reality is broken""

Good shot, Sam. To me, it seems there is still a huge gap between the declaration of values, the level of intent, and the practical work I see around, which all too often centers on issues like identity management, data vaults, and standards. Somewhere in between we must develop new ideas of what we apply that internet to - what is it for? How to use it? 
While this might seem a non-issue - after all, we all use the infrastructure daily, isn't it? - I would like to point out that much of what we can do today is the result of the 'commercial internet'. The applications we have, are there because of a business model that we reject, a mindset we abhor. 
So, of course it is important to try to keep those services, but make them safe, inclusive, respectful, etc. But my hunch is that in ten years we'll look back and say: the internet in 2019 didn't even scratch the surface! 
But we need to step back and ask that question: what is it for? What can it be used for? I recently found inspiration in a book I read some years ago: ""Reality is Broken"", by Jane McGonigal. I propose to look afresh at the NGI with her idea of 'gamification' in mind. I made the effort to elaborate that thought in https://medium.com/@joop.ringelberg/fixing-reality-the-game-is-on-612c3d...

Private addressing does not need to fragment the network

Your fragmentation story does not convice me. Addressing is just a mechanism for packet forwarding. On top of it we the end to end service. Growth of the penetration of the end to end service is due to Metcalfe's law. The value of the network keeps growing because more people join and can communicate and they join because joining has great value to people. A mere question of addresses can not change the economics. There are ways to traverse NATs smoothly, make servers in private address space reachable.
