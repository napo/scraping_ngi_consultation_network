However, for a citizen, they must be able to use the code wherever they are, even after the project ends. There needs to be the capability and wherewithal to deploy the new programs with new data after the project concludes.

Below, is a summary from Jeremy's article, including some early pioneering work on blockchain-based AI.\nThere are three essential layers to AI: the data repository; the algorithm\/machine learning engine; the AI interface.\nIf you are going to trust your decision-making to a centralised AI source, you need to have 100 percent confidence in:\n- The integrity and security of the data (are the inputs accurate and reliable, and can they be manipulated or stolen?)\n- The machine learning algorithms that inform the AI (are they prone to excessive error or bias, and can they be inspected?)\n- The AI\u2019s interface (does it reliably represent the output of the AI and effectively capture new data?)\nIn a centralised, closed model of AI, you are asked to implicitly trust in each layer without knowing what is going on behind the curtains.\nThe results can be alarming, even totally unacceptable in a democratic society. Reports by the New York Times and Wired cover the use of a proprietary machine-learning system called COMPAS, which is used by courts in many parts of the U.S. and which\u00a0 actually recommends longer prison sentences for blacks than whites, with all other data points being equal.\nThe AI makes racially-biased decisions, but no one can inspect it, and the company that makes it will not explain it. It\u2019s closed, it is hidden, and models like these are in the hands of big, powerful companies with no incentive to share them or reveal how they work.\nBlockchain + AI\nOver time, more and more data will flow into blockchains.

Below, is a summary from Jeremy's article, including some early pioneering work on blockchain-based AI.\nThere are three essential layers to AI: the data repository; the algorithm\/machine learning engine; the AI interface.\nIf you are going to trust your decision-making to a centralised AI source, you need to have 100 percent confidence in:\n- The integrity and security of the data (are the inputs accurate and reliable, and can they be manipulated or stolen?)\n- The machine learning algorithms that inform the AI (are they prone to excessive error or bias, and can they be inspected?)\n- The AI\u2019s interface (does it reliably represent the output of the AI and effectively capture new data?)\nIn a centralised, closed model of AI, you are asked to implicitly trust in each layer without knowing what is going on behind the curtains.\nThe results can be alarming, even totally unacceptable in a democratic society. Reports by the New York Times and Wired cover the use of a proprietary machine-learning system called COMPAS, which is used by courts in many parts of the U.S. and which\u00a0 actually recommends longer prison sentences for blacks than whites, with all other data points being equal.\nThe AI makes racially-biased decisions, but no one can inspect it, and the company that makes it will not explain it.

To me, it seems there is still a huge gap between the declaration of values, the level of intent, and the practical work I see around, which all too often centers on issues like identity management, data vaults, and standards. Somewhere in between we must develop new ideas of what we apply that internet to - what is it for? How to use it? \nWhile this might seem a non-issue - after all, we all use the infrastructure daily, isn't it? - I would like to point out that much of what we can do today is the result of the 'commercial internet'. The applications we have, are there because of a business model that we reject, a mindset we abhor. \nSo, of course it is important to try to keep those services, but make them safe, inclusive, respectful, etc. But my hunch is that in ten years we'll look back and say: the internet in 2019 didn't even scratch the surface! \nBut we need to step back and ask that question: what is it for? What can it be used for? I recently found inspiration in a book I read some years ago: \"Reality is Broken\", by Jane McGonigal. I propose to look afresh at the NGI with her idea of 'gamification' in mind. I made the effort to elaborate that thought in https:\/\/medium.com\/@joop.ringelberg\/fixing-reality-the-game-is-on-612c3d...\nWonder what you make of it.\nCheers, Joop\n\n\n","49":"\nInspiration from \"Reality is broken\"\n\nGood shot, Sam.

The value of the network keeps growing because more people join and can communicate and they join because joining has great value to people. A mere question of addresses can not change the economics. There are ways to traverse NATs smoothly, make servers in private address space reachable.
